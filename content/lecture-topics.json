R ranges from 0 to 1.00 (it is always positive because it represents the correlation between actual and predicted values).\n[002] R² indicates the proportion of variance in the criterion variable explained by the combination of all predictor variables. R² always increases (or stays the same) when additional predictors are added, even if those predictors have no true relationship with the criterion. For this reason, adjusted R² is often reported, which accounts for the number of predictors and sample size."

These infants appear to lack a coherent strategy for managing distress and show the highest risk for later psychopathology.\n[007] Example: In the Strange Situation, a 14-month-old becomes very upset when her mother leaves the room. When the mother returns, the child reaches out to be picked up but then immediately pushes away and cries harder, alternating between clinging and angry resistance. This pattern is most consistent with insecure-resistant (ambivalent) attachment (Type C).\n[008] Disorganized attachment has been identified as a significant risk factor for the development of dissociative symptoms, borderline personality features, and externalizing behavior problems in later childhood and adolescence. Attachment-based interventions such as Circle of Security and Child-Parent Psychotherapy target the caregiver-child relationship to promote security.\n[009] Bowlby, J.. Attachment and loss: Vol. 1.

Tend to be shy but are not actively disliked; status is unstable and generally not associated with poor outcomes\n[005] Controversial: Liked by many AND disliked by many. Often socially active and sometimes aggressive but also possess social skills\n[006] Average: Modal category; moderate numbers of likes and dislikes\n[007] Peer rejection in childhood is a significant risk factor for later problems including depression, anxiety, school dropout, and delinquency. Social skills training is one of the most common interventions for rejected children, though its effectiveness varies. Rejected-aggressive children often require additional intervention targeting hostile attribution biases (the tendency to interpret ambiguous social situations as hostile) and anger management, while rejected-withdrawn children may benefit more from social anxiety treatment and graduated exposure to social situations."

Physical symptoms may include hot flashes, sleep disturbances, and vaginal dryness. Psychological responses to menopause vary widely and are influenced by cultural attitudes, personal expectations, and individual health. Cross-cultural research has shown that women in cultures that value postmenopausal women (e.g., certain South Asian cultures) report fewer negative symptoms.\n[002] While menopause is a normal biological transition, the hormonal changes associated with perimenopause can exacerbate or precipitate depressive episodes in vulnerable women. Clinicians should assess for mood changes during this period and be aware that the relationship between menopause and depression is not deterministic but reflects a complex interaction of biological, psychological, and social factors.\n[003] Levinson, D.

    "anchors_text": "[001] Paul Baltes and colleagues at the Max Planck Institute in Berlin developed the most systematic empirical research program on wisdom. The Berlin Wisdom Paradigm defines wisdom as expert knowledge about the fundamental pragmatics of life, encompassing five criteria:\n[002] Rich factual knowledge: Extensive knowledge about the human condition and life matters.\n[003] Rich procedural knowledge: Strategies for dealing with life's problems and for offering advice, judgment, and planning.\n[004] Lifespan contextualism: Awareness of the multiple contexts of life (education, family, work) and how they change over time.\n[005] Value relativism: Acknowledgment and tolerance of differences in values and life priorities across individuals and cultures.\n[006] Recognition and management of uncertainty: Understanding that life involves uncertainty and having strategies for dealing with it.\n[007] Research using the Berlin paradigm found that wisdom does not automatically increase with age—older adults do not consistently score higher than younger adults. However, older adults with rich life experiences, high intelligence, and openness to experience have the greatest potential for wisdom. Clinical psychologists and those in mentoring professions showed relatively high wisdom scores.\n[008] The SOC model has direct clinical relevance for working with older adults. Clinicians can help aging clients identify their most valued goals (selection), develop strategies to pursue those goals effectively (optimization), and find alternative approaches when abilities change (compensation). This framework is particularly useful in rehabilitation settings, chronic illness management, and psychotherapy with older adults experiencing age-related losses.\n[009] Example: A 72-year-old retired surgeon volunteers as a medical advisor rather than continuing to perform operations.

    "anchors_text": "[001] Martin Hoffman described a developmental sequence of empathic responding:\n[002] Global empathy (newborn): Reactive crying in response to another infant's distress -- a reflexive, undifferentiated response\n[003] Egocentric empathy (~1 year): Child recognizes another's distress but offers comfort based on what would comfort the self (e.g., bringing own teddy bear to a crying adult)\n[004] Empathy for another's feelings (~2-3 years): Child begins to understand that others have different feelings and can offer appropriate comfort\n[005] Empathy for another's life condition (late childhood/adolescence): Can feel empathy for others' general life situations, including people not immediately present (e.g., empathy for the poor, for victims of injustice)\n[006] Example: A school psychologist observes a 5-year-old during play. When a classmate falls and begins crying, the child runs over, pats the classmate on the back, and says \"It's okay, do you want me to get the teacher?\" This response demonstrates empathy for another's feelings (Level 3 in Hoffman's model) -- the child recognizes the other child's distress and offers comfort appropriate to the other child's needs rather than their own. In contrast, a child at the egocentric empathy stage might offer their own favorite toy, not recognizing that the hurt child needs different forms of comfort."

Onset before 18.\n[004] Example: Coprolalia (involuntary utterance of obscene words) is often associated with Tourette's in popular culture, but it actually occurs in only about 10-15% of individuals with Tourette's disorder. The most common initial tics are facial (eye blinking, grimacing). Tourette's is highly comorbid with ADHD (approximately 50%) and OCD (approximately 30%). The CSTC circuit implicated in OCD is also involved in tic disorders."

Individuals with BPD show impaired mentalization, particularly under emotional stress, which contributes to interpersonal difficulties. MBT has demonstrated efficacy in reducing self-harm, suicide attempts, and hospitalization in BPD. The concept of mentalization overlaps with but is distinct from theory of mind, empathy, and psychological mindedness."

    "anchors_text": "[001] Caplan regarded consultee-centered case consultation as the most unique and important type. He identified four reasons a consultee may have difficulty with a case:\n[002] Lack of knowledge -- The consultee doesn't have sufficient information about the client's condition\n[003] Lack of skill -- The consultee lacks the technical ability to intervene effectively\n[004] Lack of confidence -- The consultee has the knowledge and skill but lacks self-assurance\n[005] Lack of objectivity -- The consultee's personal issues interfere with professional judgment (the most complex and interesting problem)\n[006] When a consultee lacks objectivity, Caplan attributed this to theme interference -- the consultee unconsciously links the client's situation to an unresolved personal conflict, leading to a \"syllogism\" such as: \"All women who are assertive end up alone and miserable\" (connecting the client to the consultee's personal theme). The consultant addresses this through theme interference reduction, which involves demonstrating that the feared outcome is not inevitable -- typically by examining the specifics of the case rather than by directly addressing the consultee's personal issues. The consultant never provides therapy to the consultee."

He distinguished between surface traits (observable clusters of behavior) and source traits (the underlying dimensions identified through factor analysis that cause the surface behaviors).\n[005] Eysenck proposed three broad, biologically based dimensions of personality: Psychoticism (P): Tough-mindedness, aggressiveness, antisocial tendencies, creativity Extraversion (E): Sociability, assertiveness, positive affect, sensation-seeking Neuroticism (N): Emotional instability, anxiety, moodiness, irritability\n[006] Eysenck emphasized the biological basis of personality: he proposed that extraverts have chronically lower cortical arousal (and thus seek stimulation), while introverts have higher baseline arousal (and thus avoid overstimulation). Neuroticism reflects the reactivity of the limbic system."

Traditional trait theory would see inconsistency (sometimes warm, sometimes cold). CAPS sees coherence: the person has a stable if-then profile (\"If close friend, then warm; if authority figure, then cold\") that is reliably their own.\n[003] Mischel, W., & Shoda, Y.. A cognitive-affective system theory of personality. Psychological Review, 102(2), 246–268."

    "anchors_text": "[001] Proximity (propinquity): Physical closeness is one of the strongest predictors of attraction. We tend to like people we encounter frequently. The mere exposure effect (Zajonc) contributes: repeated contact increases familiarity and liking.\n[002] Similarity: We are attracted to people who share our attitudes, values, interests, and backgrounds. The matching hypothesis states that people tend to form relationships with others of similar physical attractiveness.\n[003] Reciprocity: We like people who like us. Learning that someone is attracted to us increases our attraction to them.\n[004] Physical attractiveness: Attractive individuals are rated more positively on many dimensions (the halo effect). There is some cross-cultural consistency in what is considered attractive (e.g., facial symmetry, youthfulness cues).\n[005] People tend to form long-term partnerships with others who are similar in physical attractiveness. While people may initially prefer the most attractive partner, they ultimately choose partners whose attractiveness level matches their own, due to the balance of fear of rejection and desire for the best available partner.\n[006] Example: In the famous \"bridge study,\" male participants who crossed a fear-arousing suspension bridge were more likely to call an attractive female experimenter afterward than those who crossed a low, stable bridge. Physiological arousal from fear was misattributed to attraction, demonstrating the two-factor theory of emotion (Schachter & Singer): we experience arousal and then label it based on context.\n[007] Dutton, D. G., & Aron, A. P.. Some evidence for heightened sexual attraction under conditions of high anxiety. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 30(4), 510–517."

This pool of predominantly one-sided arguments shifts individuals further in that direction.\n[002] Social comparison theory: People discover during discussion that others hold positions more extreme than their own and shift to be at least as extreme as others to gain social approval or maintain a positive self-image.\n[003] Example: Group polarization is distinct from groupthink. Group polarization describes the direction of the shift (toward the extreme of the initial tendency), while groupthink describes a process of defective decision-making in cohesive groups. A group can polarize without experiencing groupthink, and groupthink involves more than just polarization."

Lesions may reduce aggressive behavior\n[005] Prefrontal cortex: Responsible for impulse control and behavioral regulation. Damage or reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex (particularly the orbitofrontal region) is associated with disinhibited aggression"

Can feel empathy for groups of people experiencing chronic hardship.\n[006] Hoffman's model is relevant to developmental assessments and to understanding prosocial deficits in conditions such as conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder, where empathy development may be impaired. Interventions that build empathy skills (perspective-taking exercises, social-emotional learning programs) draw on this developmental framework. In group therapy, fostering empathy among group members is a key therapeutic mechanism."

In their hospital problem, participants rated a large hospital and a small hospital as equally likely to have days where more than 60% of births are boys, when statistically the smaller hospital should have far more such days due to greater sampling variability.\n[007] Example: A forensic psychologist evaluating whether a defendant fits a \"criminal profile\" must be careful not to rely on the representativeness heuristic. Even if the defendant matches the \"typical\" profile of an offender, the actual base rate of the criminal behavior in the population must be considered. Profile matching without base rate consideration leads to inflated false positive rates.\n[008] Tversky, A., & Kahneman, D.. Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases.

Declarative memory depends critically on the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe structures.\n[002] Procedural (implicit) memory refers to knowledge of how to perform skills and procedures (e.g., riding a bicycle, typing). Procedural memories are acquired gradually through practice and are expressed through performance rather than conscious recollection. This system depends on the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and motor cortex rather than the hippocampus.\n[003] Endel Tulving proposed that episodic memory stores personally experienced events with contextual details (time, place, associated emotions) and involves \"mental time travel.\" Semantic memory stores general knowledge, facts, concepts, and vocabulary, independent of the personal context in which they were learned. Knowing that Paris is the capital of France (semantic) is distinct from remembering your trip to Paris (episodic). This distinction is critical for understanding amnesia: patients with hippocampal damage may lose the ability to form new episodic memories while retaining the ability to acquire some new semantic knowledge."

    "anchors_text": "[001] The C-SSRS is a structured interview tool for assessing suicidal ideation and behavior. It distinguishes between passive ideation (wishes to be dead), active ideation without plan, active ideation with plan, active ideation with intent, and active ideation with plan and intent, as well as actual attempts, interrupted attempts, aborted attempts, and preparatory behaviors. The C-SSRS has been adopted by the FDA, multiple federal agencies, and numerous health systems as a standard tool for suicide risk assessment. Its structured severity rating helps clinicians make more consistent and defensible risk management decisions.\n[002] Example: A therapist treating a patient with comorbid depression and anxiety administers the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 at each session. Over the first four sessions of CBT, the PHQ-9 drops from 18 (moderately severe) to 12 (moderate) and the GAD-7 from 14 (moderate) to 9 (mild), indicating meaningful improvement in both symptom domains. At session 8, the PHQ-9 unexpectedly rises to 16. The therapist uses this feedback to explore recent stressors, discovers a job loss, and adjusts the treatment plan to include behavioral activation targeting the new situational depression. Without routine monitoring, this deterioration might not have been detected until it became clinically obvious weeks later.\n[003] The concept of clinically significant change requires two conditions: (1) the patient must cross the threshold from the clinical to the non-clinical distribution (i.e., post-treatment scores fall within the normal range), and (2) the magnitude of change must exceed the Reliable Change Index (RCI), ensuring that the observed change is unlikely due to measurement error alone.

Key concepts include:\n[002] High-risk situations: Circumstances that increase vulnerability to substance use (e.g., negative emotions, interpersonal conflict, social pressure, cue exposure)\n[003] Seemingly irrelevant decisions (SIDs): Apparently minor choices that progressively move the person closer to a high-risk situation (e.g., an individual in recovery who decides to take \"the scenic route home\" that passes their former dealer's neighborhood)\n[004] Abstinence violation effect (AVE): The cognitive-emotional reaction to a lapse, characterized by internal attribution (\"I'm weak\") and a sense of loss of control, which increases the probability that the lapse will escalate to a full relapse. Challenging the AVE is a core RP strategy.\n[005] Example: A client in recovery identifies that negative affect after arguments with their spouse is their primary high-risk situation.

These base rates have important implications for the positive predictive value of validity indicators: a test that correctly identifies 90% of malingerers will produce more false positives in low-base-rate clinical settings than in high-base-rate forensic settings."

PVTs typically use tasks that appear difficult but are actually very easy, so that poor performance is more indicative of poor effort than genuine impairment. Examples include the TOMM and VSVT.\n[003] Symptom Validity Tests (SVTs): Assess whether an examinee is accurately reporting symptoms versus exaggerating or fabricating them. SVTs are embedded within or administered alongside self-report inventories. Examples include the MMPI validity scales and the SIRS-2.\n[004] Estimated base rates of malingering vary significantly across settings.

Unlike the ASEBA which is purely empirically derived, the BASC-3 was constructed using a rational-empirical approach. The BASC-3 includes validity indices (F Index for faking bad, L Index for faking good, V Index for random responding, Response Pattern Index, Consistency Index) to detect invalid profiles."

Scores are reported as Similar, Dissimilar, or Mid-range\n[005] Personal Style Scales (PSS): Assess preferences for work style, learning environment, leadership style, risk taking, and team orientation\n[006] The SII uses a criterion-keying approach for its Occupational Scales, meaning items were selected based on empirical differences between the responses of people in a given occupation and a general reference sample.\n[007] Interest inventories should be interpreted cautiously with populations who have had limited exposure to diverse activities and occupations.

Most widely used alliance measure in psychotherapy research.\n[003] Session Rating Scale (SRS): Ultra-brief (4-item) visual analog measure designed for session-by-session alliance monitoring as part of routine outcome monitoring (ROM).\n[004] Helping Alliance Questionnaire (HAq): Luborsky's measure assessing the client's perception of the therapist as supportive and the sense of working together.\n[005] Routine outcome monitoring systems such as the OQ-45 (Outcome Questionnaire) and PCOMS (Partners for Change Outcome Management System) combine alliance measurement with outcome tracking to provide real-time feedback to therapists, reducing deterioration rates and improving outcomes.\n[006] Alliance ruptures are breakdowns in the collaborative relationship, manifested as disagreements about tasks or goals, or strains in the bond. Ruptures can be withdrawal (client disengages, becomes compliant but not invested) or confrontation (client expresses dissatisfaction or hostility). Successful repair of ruptures is associated with improved outcomes and may be a key mechanism of therapeutic change, particularly for clients with interpersonal difficulties."

    "anchors_text": "[001] The Tarasoff case established the precedent for mental health professionals' duty to protect identifiable potential victims of client violence.\n[002] Tarasoff I: Established a duty to warn — the therapist must warn the identified potential victim\n[003] Tarasoff II: Broadened to a duty to protect — the therapist must take reasonable steps to protect the potential victim, which may include warning but also hospitalization, notification of police, or other interventions\n[004] The duty to protect applies when the therapist determines (or should have determined) that the client poses a serious threat of violence to a reasonably identifiable victim. States vary considerably in their implementation of Tarasoff principles — some have codified the duty by statute, others apply it through case law, and a few have explicitly rejected it.\n[005] Example: A client tells their therapist, \"If my ex-wife brings her new boyfriend to my daughter's recital next week, I'm going to kill him.\" The therapist must assess whether this represents a serious, imminent threat to a reasonably identifiable victim. Factors to consider include: the specificity of the threat (identified person, time, and place), the client's history of violence, access to means, and current mental state. If the therapist concludes the threat is credible, the duty to protect may require warning the identified potential victim, notifying law enforcement, adjusting treatment (e.g., voluntary or involuntary hospitalization), or a combination of these interventions."

Bordin's alliance model identifies three components: agreement on tasks (the specific activities that take place in supervision), agreement on goals (the desired outcomes of supervision), and the emotional bond (mutual trust, respect, and liking between supervisor and supervisee).\n[002] Ruptures in the supervisory alliance require the same attentive repair as therapeutic alliance ruptures. However, the power differential in supervision makes alliance repair more complex — supervisees may be reluctant to express dissatisfaction for fear of negative evaluation. Supervisors must actively create conditions that allow supervisees to provide honest feedback about the supervisory process. Research shows that unresolved supervisory alliance ruptures are associated with nondisclosure by supervisees, reduced learning, and negative supervisory outcomes."

Consistent profiles are more stable and predictable.\n[003] Differentiation: A person who strongly resembles one type and little resembles others is well-differentiated.

This is a major advantage over TCAs and MAOIs, particularly in patients with suicidal ideation.\n[003] Most benzodiazepines (when taken alone) -- wide TI, but significantly narrowed when combined with other CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids).\n[004] The EPPP frequently tests the clinical monitoring requirements for narrow therapeutic index drugs, especially lithium. Know the therapeutic range, signs of toxicity, and factors that alter lithium levels (dehydration, NSAIDs, diuretics, sodium restriction). Lithium toxicity presents as coarse tremor, ataxia, slurred speech, confusion, and can progress to seizures, coma, and death."
