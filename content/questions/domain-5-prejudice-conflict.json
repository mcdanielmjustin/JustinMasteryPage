      "explanation": "Stereotype threat (Steele & Aronson, 1995) occurs when awareness of a negative stereotype about one's group creates apprehension that impairs performance by consuming working memory resources. The person does not need to believe the stereotype -- mere awareness is sufficient. Self-fulfilling prophecy operates through examiner behavior shaping outcomes, which is a different mechanism. Implicit bias in test content would be a psychometric issue, not a situational performance decrement. Aversive racism describes unconscious bias in egalitarian individuals, not the test-taker's experience.",
