      "options": [
        "The intensity of the sexual interest",
        "The presence of distress or impairment, or action on non-consenting persons",
        "The duration of the sexual interest",
        "Whether the interest involves illegal behavior"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "DSM-5 distinguishes paraphilia (atypical sexual interest) from paraphilic disorder, which requires: (1) personal distress (not merely from societal disapproval) OR (2) functional impairment OR (3) acting on the interest with non-consenting persons. A paraphilia alone is not a mental disorder; only when it causes distress/impairment or involves non-consent does it become a disorder.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Exhibitionistic disorder involves recurrent, intense sexual arousal from exposing genitals to unsuspecting persons, manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors over ≥6 months, causing distress or impairment, or acting on these urges with non-consenting persons. His distress and non-consensual behavior clearly meet disorder criteria. Voyeurism involves observing, frotteurism involves touching.",

These inherently involve non-consent. Sexual masochism is self-directed (consensual by definition when alone) so only requires personal distress/impairment—acting on a masochistic fantasy alone doesn't involve non-consent.",
