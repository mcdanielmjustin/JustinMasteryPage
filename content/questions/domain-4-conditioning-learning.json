      "explanation": "Systematic desensitization, developed by Wolpe, involves three steps: (1) relaxation training (PMR), (2) construction of an anxiety hierarchy using SUDs, and (3) pairing relaxation with progressive imaginal exposure to hierarchy items. It is based on reciprocal inhibition -- anxiety and relaxation are incompatible responses. Flooding involves intense exposure without relaxation. Implosive therapy (Stampfl) involves imaginal flooding with psychodynamic themes. ERP is specifically for OCD.",

      "explanation": "ERP is the gold standard treatment for OCD. It combines exposure (contact with the obsession-triggering stimulus -- doorknobs) with response prevention (refraining from the compulsive ritual -- hand-washing). Both components are necessary: exposure activates the anxiety, and response prevention prevents the compulsion from providing negative reinforcement, allowing the anxiety to habituate and the obsession-compulsion cycle to break.",

      "explanation": "If a flooding session is terminated before habituation occurs, the client escapes at peak anxiety. This escape is negatively reinforced (the aversive anxiety is removed), which strengthens the avoidance behavior and can lead to sensitization -- an actual increase in fear. This is why flooding sessions must be long enough (typically 60-90 minutes) for anxiety to habituate. Premature escape is one of the primary risks of flooding.",
