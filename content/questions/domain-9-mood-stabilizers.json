      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Lithium has a very narrow therapeutic index (therapeutic range 0.6-1.2 mEq/L; toxic above 1.5 mEq/L). Regular monitoring must include serum lithium levels to ensure therapeutic range. Additionally, lithium can cause nephrotoxicity (affecting renal function/creatinine) and hypothyroidism (requiring thyroid function tests including TSH). Lithium toxicity can be fatal, causing neurological symptoms, cardiac arrhythmias, and renal failure. Factors affecting lithium levels include hydration, sodium intake, and concurrent medications (NSAIDs, diuretics).",

      "explanation": "Valproate carries a risk of hepatotoxicity, which can be fatal, particularly in the first 6 months of treatment and in children under 2 years. Liver function tests (LFTs) must be monitored before starting and regularly during treatment. Other significant side effects include: teratogenicity (neural tube defects--it is contraindicated in pregnancy when possible), pancreatitis, thrombocytopenia, weight gain, tremor, and hair loss.

      "explanation": "Lithium has a narrow therapeutic index (0.6-1.2 mEq/L), and toxicity occurs at levels above 1.5 mEq/L. Thiazide diuretics are a well-known precipitant of lithium toxicity because they increase sodium excretion, and the kidney reabsorbs lithium in place of sodium, raising lithium levels. Other factors that can increase lithium levels include dehydration, NSAIDs (which reduce renal blood flow), ACE inhibitors, and low-sodium diets. Conversely, a high-sodium diet would tend to decrease lithium levels (not increase them), increased water intake would not significantly raise lithium, and antacids do not meaningfully interact with lithium. Signs of lithium toxicity progress from mild (fine tremor, GI upset) to moderate (coarse tremor, ataxia, confusion) to severe (seizures, coma, death).",

The risk is highest during the first 8 weeks of treatment and is significantly increased by rapid dose escalation. The standard titration protocol starts at 25 mg/day (or 25 mg every other day if combined with valproate, which inhibits lamotrigine metabolism) and increases very gradually over 6+ weeks.

Its most serious organ toxicity is [BLANK2], which is most dangerous in the first 6 months and in children under age 2. In pregnancy, valproate is associated with [BLANK3], making it the most teratogenic mood stabilizer. Blood monitoring for valproate should include serum drug levels (therapeutic range 50-125 mcg/mL), liver function tests, and [BLANK4] due to the risk of thrombocytopenia. Valproate is a [BLANK5] of hepatic enzymes, which can increase levels of co-administered drugs like lamotrigine.",

      "explanation": "INCREASES: Thiazide diuretics increase lithium by promoting sodium excretion with compensatory lithium reabsorption (item1). NSAIDs increase lithium by reducing prostaglandin-mediated renal blood flow (item3). Valproate inhibits lamotrigine glucuronidation, doubling lamotrigine levels (item4). ACE inhibitors increase lithium by reducing GFR (item6). DECREASES: Carbamazepine autoinduction reduces its own levels (item2). Carbamazepine induces valproate metabolism, lowering valproate levels (item5). High-sodium diet increases lithium excretion (item7). Carbamazepine induces lamotrigine metabolism, reducing lamotrigine levels (item8). These interactions are clinically critical for safe mood stabilizer management.",
