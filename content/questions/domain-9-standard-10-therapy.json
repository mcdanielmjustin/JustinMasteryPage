When a psychologist experiences attraction to a client, the ethical obligation is to seek consultation or supervision, maintain professional boundaries, and evaluate whether the therapeutic relationship can be maintained without compromise to the client's care. If the therapist's objectivity is impaired, referral to another competent provider is appropriate. Terminating to pursue a romantic relationship would be exploitative. Disclosing mutual attraction could be experienced as coercive given the power differential. Allowing boundary erosion violates multiple ethical standards.
