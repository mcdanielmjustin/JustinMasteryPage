      "explanation": "Persistent Depressive Disorder (formerly Dysthymia) requires depressed mood most of the day, more days than not, for ≥2 years in adults (1 year in children/adolescents), plus ≥2 additional symptoms. The chronicity (3 years) without meeting full MDE criteria points to PDD. MDD requires discrete episodes meeting full criteria; Adjustment Disorder is time-limited (<6 months after stressor ends); Bipolar II requires history of hypomania. PDD can co-occur with MDE ('double depression').",

      "explanation": "The kindling hypothesis (Post) proposes that early mood episodes are often precipitated by psychosocial stressors, but successive episodes become increasingly autonomous—occurring with smaller triggers or spontaneously. This is analogous to seizure kindling where repeated stimulation lowers the threshold. This has implications for prevention: early, aggressive treatment may prevent kindling and reduce recurrence risk. Later episodes don't require larger stressors (A is opposite); episodes often worsen, not improve (C); treatment can become less effective with recurrence (D).",

MAOIs have historically shown superior efficacy for atypical depression, though SSRIs are commonly used first-line due to better tolerability.",
