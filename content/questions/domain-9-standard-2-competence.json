      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Standard 2.01(a) requires psychologists to provide services only within the boundaries of their competence, based on education, training, supervised experience, consultation, study, or professional experience. Working with a 7-year-old with selective mutism requires specialized knowledge in child development, child psychopathology, age-appropriate assessment, and child-specific therapeutic techniques that differ substantially from adult CBT. Self-study alone (B) is insufficient for a specialization this distant from the psychologist's training. While consultation (D) can sometimes supplement competence in adjacent areas, this case represents a completely new population and set of clinical skills. The most ethical action is to refer to a qualified child specialist. Accepting the case with minimal preparation risks harm to the child client.",

      "explanation": "Standard 2.01 (Boundaries of Competence) is violated when psychologists practice in areas requiring distinct competencies they lack: conducting neuropsych evaluations without neuropsych training and conducting group therapy without group-specific training. Standard 2.02 (Emergencies) applies to the school psychologist providing immediate crisis response when no trained crisis professional is available -- this is the temporary emergency exception. Standard 2.03 (Maintaining Competence) is violated by failing to update diagnostic knowledge through multiple DSM revisions. Standard 2.06 (Personal Problems) is implicated by chronic pain-related cognitive difficulties and unaddressed grief reactions affecting sessions -- both require the psychologist to take proactive measures.",

      "explanation": "Developing new competence (Standard 2.01) involves activities that build skills in areas outside one's current practice: a post-doctoral certificate in a new specialty, supervised experience in neuropsychology, and specialized EMDR training. Maintaining existing competence (Standard 2.03) involves activities that keep current skills sharp: attending conferences in one's specialty, case consultation within one's area, and continuing education in current practice areas. Strengthening the scientific basis (Standard 2.04) involves activities focused on evidence and science: reviewing meta-analyses and systematic reviews, and reviewing empirical evidence before making treatment recommendations. These categories overlap in practice but represent distinct ethical obligations.",
