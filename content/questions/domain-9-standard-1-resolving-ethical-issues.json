In this scenario, the corporation is attempting to use the psychologist's professional expertise to create a discriminatory screening instrument that would violate both the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and principles of valid test construction. Simply complying (A), adding a disclaimer (B), or removing one's name (D) would not constitute taking reasonable steps to correct the misuse. The psychologist must actively address the problem, which includes clarifying the appropriate use of psychological instruments and refusing to participate in developing an invalid, discriminatory tool.",

      "explanation": "Standard 1.01 (Misuse) applies when the psychologist's work products are being misused: selective quotation of a custody report to support the opposite conclusion and unauthorized use of IQ scores for segregation. Standard 1.02 (Ethics-Law) applies when a legal requirement conflicts with ethics: mandatory reporting of drug use and court-ordered breach of privilege. Standard 1.03 (Organizational Demands) applies when an employer requires ethically problematic conduct: premature discharge of a suicidal patient and mandatory diagnoses regardless of clinical presentation. These distinctions are critical because each standard provides different resolution guidance.",

      "explanation": "Consistent actions include: filing evidence-based complaints (1.05), informal collegial conversation for minor issues (1.04), contacting publishers about test misuse (1.01), and making known ethical concerns about organizational demands (1.03). Inconsistent actions include: refusing to cooperate with investigations (violates 1.06), retaliating against a complainant (violates 1.08), filing meritless competitive complaints (violates 1.07), and ignoring evidence of insurance fraud (violates 1.05's requirement to take appropriate action when substantial harm is occurring).
