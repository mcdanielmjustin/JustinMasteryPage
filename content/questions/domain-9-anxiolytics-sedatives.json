      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Benzodiazepines are positive allosteric modulators of the GABA-A receptor. They bind to a specific benzodiazepine site on the GABA-A receptor complex, increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening when GABA is present. Critically, they do NOT directly open the channel (that would be barbiturates' mechanism). This means benzodiazepines have a ceiling effect and are safer in overdose than barbiturates. Their effects require endogenous GABA to be present, which provides a built-in safety mechanism.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Buspirone is a 5-HT1A partial agonist used for GAD. Unlike benzodiazepines, which produce immediate anxiolytic effects through GABA-A modulation, buspirone requires 2-4 weeks for therapeutic effects because it works through serotonergic mechanisms requiring neuroadaptation. Advantages over benzodiazepines include: no dependence/withdrawal potential, no sedation, no cognitive impairment, and no interaction with alcohol. However, patients previously treated with benzodiazepines may report buspirone as less effective because they expect immediate relief.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Elderly patients are particularly vulnerable to long-acting benzodiazepines due to age-related pharmacokinetic changes: decreased hepatic Phase I metabolism (oxidation) slows clearance of diazepam and its active metabolite desmethyldiazepam, increased body fat increases the volume of distribution for lipophilic drugs, and reduced albumin may increase free drug levels. These factors lead to drug accumulation, causing excessive sedation, cognitive impairment (sometimes misdiagnosed as dementia), ataxia, and significantly increased fall/hip fracture risk. The Beers Criteria explicitly recommend against long-acting benzodiazepines in the elderly. If a benzodiazepine must be used, short-acting agents like lorazepam or oxazepam (which undergo Phase II conjugation, less affected by aging) are preferred.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Both alcohol and benzodiazepines enhance GABA-A receptor function (though through somewhat different mechanisms), resulting in cross-tolerance. Chronic alcohol use leads to compensatory downregulation of GABA-A receptors and upregulation of excitatory glutamate (NMDA) receptors. Abrupt cessation produces a dangerous hyperexcitable state that can cause seizures, delirium tremens, autonomic instability, and death. Benzodiazepines substitute for alcohol at GABA-A receptors, preventing this hyperexcitability. Long-acting benzodiazepines like chlordiazepoxide or diazepam are typically preferred for a smooth taper, while lorazepam may be chosen for patients with hepatic impairment due to its Phase II metabolism.",

They are most common in elderly patients, children, individuals with developmental disabilities, and those with organic brain damage. The mechanism is not fully understood but may involve disinhibition of previously suppressed behaviors when cortical inhibitory circuits are impaired.

      "explanation": "Positive allosteric modulators (benzodiazepines): Diazepam, alprazolam, and clonazepam all bind the benzodiazepine site on GABA-A, increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening when GABA binds. They require endogenous GABA and have a ceiling effect. Direct channel openers (barbiturates): Phenobarbital and pentobarbital increase the duration of channel opening and at high doses can open channels without GABA, explaining their greater overdose lethality. Selective alpha-1 agonists (Z-drugs): Zolpidem and zaleplon selectively bind the alpha-1 subunit, mediating sedation with minimal anxiolytic or muscle relaxant effects. Non-GABA-A: Buspirone is a 5-HT1A partial agonist with no GABA-A activity whatsoever.",
