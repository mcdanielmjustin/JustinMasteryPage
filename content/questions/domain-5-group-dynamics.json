      "explanation": "Zajonc's (1965) drive theory of social facilitation proposes that the presence of others increases physiological arousal, which strengthens the emission of the dominant response. For an expert pianist, the well-practiced concerto is the dominant response, so audience presence enhances performance. For a novice, the dominant response would be incorrect (errors), so audience presence would impair performance. This distinction between simple/well-learned tasks and complex/novel tasks is central to social facilitation theory.",
