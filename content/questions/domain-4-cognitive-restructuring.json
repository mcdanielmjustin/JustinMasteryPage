      "explanation": "Overgeneralization involves drawing a sweeping conclusion from a single event. The client takes one exam failure and generalizes it to the entirety of graduate school. Catastrophizing would involve predicting the worst possible outcome (e.g., 'I'll be expelled and never get a job'). Personalization involves attributing external events to oneself without basis.
