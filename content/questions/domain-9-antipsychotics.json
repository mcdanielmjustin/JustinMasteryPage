      "explanation": "Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is characterized by involuntary, repetitive movements primarily of the orofacial muscles (tongue, lips, jaw) and can affect the trunk and extremities. It typically develops after prolonged exposure to dopamine-blocking agents (especially first-generation antipsychotics like haloperidol) and may persist even after medication discontinuation. Acute dystonia involves sustained muscle contractions occurring early in treatment. Akathisia involves subjective restlessness. NMS involves rigidity, fever, and autonomic instability.",

      "explanation": "First-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) like haloperidol, chlorpromazine, and fluphenazine primarily work by blocking dopamine D2 receptors. Their therapeutic effects on positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions) are attributed to D2 blockade specifically in the mesolimbic pathway. However, non-selective D2 blockade in other pathways causes side effects: nigrostriatal (EPS), tuberoinfundibular (prolactin elevation), and mesocortical (worsening negative symptoms).

Initially, blood draws are weekly for the first 6 months, biweekly for the next 6 months, then monthly thereafter if counts remain stable.

      "explanation": "Typical (first-generation) antipsychotics include chlorpromazine (the first antipsychotic, a low-potency phenothiazine), haloperidol (a high-potency butyrophenone), and fluphenazine (a high-potency phenothiazine available in long-acting injectable form). These primarily block D2 receptors and have higher EPS risk. Atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics include olanzapine (high metabolic risk), quetiapine (commonly used for insomnia at low doses), and aripiprazole (unique as a partial D2 agonist/dopamine system stabilizer). These generally have lower EPS risk but higher metabolic risk. Mood stabilizers/anticonvulsants used in bipolar disorder include valproic acid (effective for mania, teratogenic), carbamazepine (with autoinduction), and lamotrigine (primarily for bipolar depression prevention, risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome).",
