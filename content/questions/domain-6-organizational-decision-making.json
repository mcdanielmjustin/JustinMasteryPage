      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Herbert Simon (1957) challenged the classical economic model of perfect rationality. Bounded rationality recognizes that decision-makers have limited cognitive processing capacity, incomplete information, and time constraints. Rather than searching for the optimal solution (maximizing), they 'satisfice'—searching until they find a solution that meets a minimum acceptable threshold. Simon received the Nobel Prize in Economics for this work. Bounded rationality is foundational to organizational decision-making theory and contrasts with the rational-economic model of decision-making.",

      "explanation": "Janis (1972) identified groupthink as a mode of thinking in highly cohesive groups where the desire for unanimity overrides realistic appraisal of alternatives. Antecedent conditions include: high cohesiveness, insulation from external experts, lack of methodical search procedures, directive leadership, and high stress. Symptoms include illusion of invulnerability, collective rationalization, belief in group's inherent morality, stereotyping outgroups, self-censorship, illusion of unanimity, pressure on dissenters, and self-appointed mindguards.

Decisions result from the temporal coincidence of four independent streams: problems (concerns requiring attention), solutions (answers looking for questions), participants (who happens to be involved), and choice opportunities (occasions for decisions). Solutions may be attached to problems they weren't designed to address, and participation varies unpredictably. This model captures the messy reality of decision-making in complex organizations.",
