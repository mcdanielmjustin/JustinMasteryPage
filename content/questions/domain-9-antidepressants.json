      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "This is a classic hypertensive crisis caused by the tyramine reaction with MAOIs. Tyramine is found in aged cheeses, cured meats, fermented foods, and certain wines. Normally, MAO-A in the gut metabolizes ingested tyramine before it enters systemic circulation. When MAO-A is inhibited by MAOIs like phenelzine (an irreversible, nonselective MAOI), tyramine accumulates and causes massive norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerve terminals, producing a potentially fatal hypertensive crisis. This is why MAOI dietary restrictions are critical.",

Importantly, studies have shown that for adults aged 25-64, antidepressants have a neutral effect on suicidality, and for adults over 65, they may actually reduce suicidal ideation.

      "explanation": "MAOIs inhibit the enzyme monoamine oxidase, which normally breaks down tyramine in the gut. When patients on MAOIs consume tyramine-rich foods (aged cheeses, cured meats, fermented products, red wine), unmetabolized tyramine enters the bloodstream and triggers massive norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerve terminals. This produces a hypertensive crisis characterized by severe headache (often occipital), diaphoresis, nausea, tachycardia or bradycardia, and dangerously elevated blood pressure that can lead to stroke or death. This is distinct from serotonin syndrome (which involves agitation, clonus, hyperthermia) and NMS (which involves rigidity, fever, altered consciousness with antipsychotics).",

Its dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibition provides antidepressant efficacy while the noradrenergic component contributes to descending pain inhibition in the spinal cord. Fluoxetine would address depression but has no specific pain indication. Trazodone at typical doses acts primarily as a sedative-hypnotic and would not address fatigue or pain.

Symptoms typically begin within 1-3 days and include dizziness, electric shock sensations ('brain zaps'), irritability, nausea, insomnia, and flu-like symptoms. Paroxetine has the highest risk among SSRIs due to its short half-life (approximately 21 hours), lack of active metabolites, and anticholinergic rebound effects.

      "explanation": "Avoid MAOIs in patients who consume tyramine-rich foods (hypertensive crisis risk), those on SSRIs without adequate washout (serotonin syndrome risk, minimum 2-week washout for most SSRIs, 5 weeks for fluoxetine), and those on triptans (serotonin syndrome risk). Avoid TCAs in suicidal patients (lethal in overdose from cardiac toxicity) and those with cardiac conduction abnormalities (sodium channel blockade worsens QRS prolongation). Avoid bupropion in seizure disorder (dose-dependent seizure risk) and bulimia (increased seizure risk with purging-related electrolyte abnormalities; this is a specific FDA contraindication). Avoid paroxetine in pregnancy due to association with cardiac malformations (FDA Category D).",
