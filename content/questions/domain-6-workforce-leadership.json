      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Meta-analytic research (Schmidt & Hunter, 1998) demonstrates that general mental ability (GMA) tests have the highest single predictor validity for job performance (.51). When combined with structured interviews (which add incremental validity of about .12), the combination achieves the highest overall predictive validity (.63). Structured interviews also have lower adverse impact than cognitive tests alone, partially offsetting the adverse impact of GMA tests. Unstructured interviews have much lower validity (.38) and graphology has near-zero validity. Personality tests alone have modest validity (.31 for conscientiousness), and years of experience has lower validity than GMA (.18).",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Fiedler's Contingency Model proposes that leadership effectiveness depends on the match between leadership style (task-oriented vs. relationship-oriented, measured by the Least Preferred Coworker scale) and situational favorability (determined by leader-member relations, task structure, and position power). Task-oriented leaders are most effective in extreme situations—either very favorable (good relations, structured tasks, strong power) or very unfavorable (poor relations, unstructured tasks, weak power). Relationship-oriented leaders are most effective in moderately favorable situations. A key feature of Fiedler's model is that leadership style is considered relatively fixed, so the situation should be modified to fit the leader rather than vice versa.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory (Motivation-Hygiene Theory) proposes that satisfaction and dissatisfaction are not opposite ends of a single continuum but are influenced by different factors. Hygiene factors (salary, working conditions, supervision, company policies, job security) prevent dissatisfaction when adequate but do not create satisfaction or motivation. Motivators (achievement, recognition, the work itself, responsibility, advancement) create satisfaction and motivation when present. Thus, improving hygiene factors only moves employees from dissatisfied to not dissatisfied (neutral), while motivators are needed to move from neutral to satisfied/motivated.

      "explanation": "The Position Analysis Questionnaire (PAQ), developed by McCormick, Jeanneret, and Mecham, is a structured, worker-oriented job analysis instrument. It analyzes jobs along 187 job elements organized into six divisions: information input, mental processes, work output, relationships with others, job context, and other job characteristics. Because it focuses on generalized human behaviors rather than specific tasks, it allows comparison across different jobs. This contrasts with task-oriented methods (which describe specific job duties), competency modeling (which focuses on KSAs for specific roles), and the critical incident technique (which collects behavioral examples of effective/ineffective performance).",

Structured interviews, particularly behavioral interviews (based on past behavior), demonstrate solid validity (.51 for structured vs. .38 for unstructured). Conscientiousness is the strongest Big Five personality predictor of job performance (.31).

      "explanation": "Adams' Equity Theory posits that employees assess fairness by comparing their own input/outcome ratio to that of comparison others (referent others). When a discrepancy is perceived, a state of tension (inequity distress) arises that motivates attempts to restore equity. Restoration methods include: altering inputs (working harder or less), altering outcomes (requesting a raise), cognitive distortion (reinterpreting the situation), changing the referent other, or leaving the field (quitting). Option C is incorrect because overpayment inequity does not always increase performance—research shows it may temporarily increase quantity but not necessarily quality, and people often cognitively distort the situation rather than change behavior.",

      "explanation": "Locke and Latham's Goal-Setting Theory identifies several moderators of the goal-performance relationship: Goal commitment is essential—goals only work when people are committed to them. Task complexity moderates the effect: for simple tasks, specific difficult goals enhance performance directly, but for complex tasks, people may need strategies and learning goals rather than performance goals. Feedback is necessary for goal pursuit—without it, people cannot monitor progress. Self-efficacy influences goal choice, commitment, and persistence. Option D is incorrect—research shows both proximal (short-term) and distal (long-term) goals are important; proximal goals enhance motivation by providing immediate targets and facilitating self-efficacy.",

Hersey-Blanchard's Situational Leadership proposes leaders should adapt their style (telling, selling, participating, delegating) based on followers' readiness (ability and willingness). House's Path-Goal Theory states leaders motivate by making paths to goals clear, removing obstacles, and providing appropriate support—the leader's style should match subordinate and environmental characteristics.

In this case, team members who contributed equally but received no reward perceive underpayment inequity compared to the rewarded colleague. Reducing effort (inputs) is a classic equity restoration strategy—by decreasing their inputs, they bring their ratio closer to balance.
