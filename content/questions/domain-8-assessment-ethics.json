      "explanation": "Under Standards 9.04 and 9.11, psychologists distinguish between test data (scores, client responses, notes) and test materials (manuals, stimulus items, protocols). Test materials are protected for test security purposes. When faced with legal demands for test materials, the psychologist should first attempt to educate the requesting party about test security concerns and negotiate alternatives (e.g., in camera review, limiting access to qualified professionals). Simply complying without attempting to protect test security would violate Standard 9.11, while outright refusal may not be legally defensible."

      "explanation": "Research on predictive bias using Cleary's model (qualified individualism) has consistently shown that standardized cognitive tests slightly overpredict the academic performance of minority groups. This means that predicted criterion scores are higher than actual performance for minority examinees when using a common regression equation. This overprediction finding is counterintuitive but well-established. It means test bias against minorities cannot explain lower criterion performance -- the tests are actually 'generous' in their predictions. This is a frequently tested concept on the EPPP."

Adverse impact may be indicated when the selection rate for a protected group is less than four-fifths (80%) of the rate for the group with the highest selection rate. For example, if 60% of majority applicants are selected and only 40% of minority applicants are selected, the ratio is 40/60 = 0.67, which is below 0.80 and suggests adverse impact. The rule applies to selection rates, not raw scores or reliability coefficients."

The client's score of 73 on 1980 norms would be approximately 61.5 on 2020 norms, well within the intellectual disability range. Outdated norms made the score appear higher, which could cause a missed diagnosis. This demonstrates why Standard 9.08 prohibits use of obsolete tests.
