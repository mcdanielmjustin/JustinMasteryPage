      ],
      "explanation": "BII phobia is unique among phobias because it involves a diphasic physiological response: initial sympathetic activation followed by a strong parasympathetic response (vasovagal syncope). Applied tension (Ost & Sterner) involves tensing the large muscles of the body during exposure to maintain blood pressure and prevent fainting. Relaxation training is actually contraindicated for BII phobia because it would further lower blood pressure.",
