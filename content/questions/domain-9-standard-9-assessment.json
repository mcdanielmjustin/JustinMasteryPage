      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Standard 9.01(a) requires that psychologists base their assessments on information and techniques sufficient to substantiate their findings. When circumstances limit the assessment (9.01(b)), such as an attorney's objection to testing, the psychologist must document the nature and extent of the limitation and its impact on the reliability and validity of the opinions rendered. The psychologist should attempt to negotiate for appropriate assessment methods, and if unable to conduct an adequate examination, must clearly state the limitations in the report rather than either abandoning the evaluation or conducting unauthorized testing.",

Standard 9.02(b) further requires that when tests have not been established for the population in question, psychologists describe the strengths and limitations of test results and interpretation. Using tests normed on a different age group and language population without acknowledging these limitations would lead to potentially invalid conclusions. Informal translation invalidates standardized administration. The psychologist should seek culturally and linguistically appropriate instruments when possible, and clearly document any interpretive limitations.",

      "explanation": "Standard 9.04 addresses the tension between client access rights and test security. With a client authorization, psychologists provide test data to the person identified in the release. However, the psychologist may refrain from releasing data to protect the client or others from substantial harm or misuse. Additionally, Standard 9.11 (Maintaining Test Security) creates an obligation to protect test materials. The psychologist must balance the client's right to access their data against the potential for harm and the need to maintain test security.

However, the standard permits delegation of certain assessment tasks (such as standardized administration and scoring) to trained technicians under the psychologist's supervision.

Psychological functioning can change substantially over five years due to development, treatment, life events, or progression of conditions. Basing current diagnostic opinions on five-year-old data would be ethically inappropriate because the results may not reflect the client's current psychological status.

      "explanation": "Test data (Standard 9.04) includes: raw scores (item1), the psychologist's notes about client behavior during testing (item3), and scaled scores with profile interpretations (item5). These are client-specific products of the assessment. Test materials (Standard 9.11) include: administration manuals (item2), stimulus materials like Rorschach inkblot cards (item4), and copyrighted test questions (item6). These are the instruments themselves, which must be protected to maintain test security. This distinction is critical because test data may be released with client authorization while test materials have additional security protections.",
