      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Weber's (1922) bureaucratic model describes an 'ideal type' (theoretical construct, not necessarily ideal in a normative sense) characterized by: clear hierarchy of authority, formal rules and procedures, division of labor and specialization, impersonal relationships (decisions based on rules, not personal favoritism), selection and promotion based on technical competence, and written documentation. Weber saw bureaucracy as the most rational and efficient form of organization. Critics (Merton, Gouldner) later identified dysfunctions: trained incapacity, goal displacement, and rigid adherence to rules that undermines organizational goals.",

Theory X assumes workers are lazy, dislike work, avoid responsibility, and must be coerced and controlled. Theory Y assumes work is as natural as play, workers can be self-directed and creative, seek responsibility, and are motivated by higher-order needs when organizational conditions allow. McGregor argued that Theory X creates a self-fulfilling prophecy—controlling management produces passive, dependent workers. Theory Y management, by contrast, creates conditions for self-actualization. This connects to Maslow's hierarchy and Argyris's maturity theory.",
