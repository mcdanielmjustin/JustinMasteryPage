(1) Nonverbal tests such as Raven's Progressive Matrices are considered culture-free because they eliminate all cultural influences from the testing situation. (2) The KABC-II Luria model is recommended for culturally diverse examinees because it excludes the Knowledge/Gc scale from the global score. (3) The Leiter-3 uses pantomime and gestural instructions, making it appropriate for examinees who cannot understand spoken language. (4) Using an interpreter to translate verbal subtests of the WISC-V is an acceptable accommodation that maintains the test's standardized administration. (5) The term 'culture-reduced' is preferred over 'culture-free' because no test can completely eliminate all cultural influences on performance.

      "explanation": "PHQ-9 measures depression severity (9 items mapping to DSM-5 MDD criteria). GAD-7 measures generalized anxiety severity (also sensitive to panic, social anxiety, PTSD). PCL-5 measures PTSD symptoms (20 items across 4 DSM-5 PTSD clusters). OQ-45 is a general psychotherapy outcome measure (3 subscales: Symptom Distress, Interpersonal Relations, Social Role). AUDIT screens for hazardous alcohol use (WHO-developed, 10 items). C-SSRS assesses suicidal ideation and behavior, which is grouped with depression instruments in clinical practice. Note: The C-SSRS is technically a suicide risk measure rather than a depression measure, but in this context it is most closely associated with depression assessment in measurement-based care.",
