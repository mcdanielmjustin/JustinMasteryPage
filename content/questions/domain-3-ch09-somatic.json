      "stem": "A woman presents with paralysis of her left arm that began suddenly after learning of her mother's death. Neurological examination and imaging reveal no organic cause. She appears surprisingly unconcerned about the paralysis. What symptom is this lack of concern called, and what is the diagnosis?",

      "explanation": "'La belle indifférence' (beautiful indifference) describes inappropriate lack of concern about physical symptoms, classically associated with conversion disorder. The sudden onset after psychological stressor (mother's death), motor symptom incompatible with neurological disease, confirms conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder). Note: la belle indifférence isn't universal and isn't diagnostic.",

The therapeutic relationship should emphasize validation of the patient's suffering while gently expanding the explanatory model for symptoms. Scheduled regular appointments are preferable to symptom-contingent visits, reducing healthcare seeking behavior. The treatment should focus on improving functioning and quality of life rather than eliminating symptoms. A single designated provider should coordinate care to prevent unnecessary tests and procedures. Directly confronting the patient that their symptoms are 'all in their head' helps break through denial. Mind-body approaches like relaxation and behavioral activation can reduce symptom burden. Repeated invasive testing should be performed to definitively rule out all possible medical conditions.",
