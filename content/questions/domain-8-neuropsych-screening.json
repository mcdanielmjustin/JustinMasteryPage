This discrepancy is because the MoCA includes executive function tasks (Trail Making B adaptation, clock drawing, abstraction) that the MMSE lacks, and the MoCA has a higher ceiling, reducing the education bias that inflates MMSE scores in more educated individuals. The MoCA also adds 1 point for individuals with 12 or fewer years of education. A score of 26/30 on the MMSE does not rule out MCI, making the MoCA the superior screening choice.",

When this pattern is reversed -- with the non-dominant left hand outperforming the dominant right hand -- it suggests dysfunction in the left hemisphere, which controls right-hand motor function.

Two patients can achieve the same total score through very different cognitive processes, and the process approach reveals these clinically meaningful differences.
