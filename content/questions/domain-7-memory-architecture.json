      "explanation": "Sperling's partial-report paradigm demonstrated iconic memory -- a brief (approximately 250-500 ms), high-capacity visual sensory memory store. When cued immediately, participants could report any row, indicating that all information was briefly available. But after about 500 ms, the iconic trace had faded, and participants could only report 4-5 items (the capacity of short-term memory). This dissociation between immediate full availability and rapid decay defines iconic memory as distinct from short-term memory.",
