      "explanation": "In Minuchin's structural family therapy, enmeshment refers to diffuse, overly permeable boundaries between subsystem members, resulting in excessive closeness and loss of individual autonomy. The mother-son dyad shows hallmarks of enmeshment: extreme closeness, mind-reading, and blurred boundaries. The father's disengagement represents the opposite pole — rigid boundaries with emotional distance. Healthy families have clear (neither enmeshed nor disengaged) boundaries.",
