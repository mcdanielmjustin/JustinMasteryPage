When people engage in counterattitudinal behavior (saying a boring task was fun) with minimal external justification ($1), they experience dissonance between their behavior ('I said it was fun') and their attitude ('It was boring'). Because the $1 is insufficient to justify the lie, they reduce dissonance by changing their attitude toward the task. The $20 group had sufficient external justification ('I said it was fun because I was well paid'), so no dissonance was aroused and no attitude change occurred.",

      "explanation": "Katz's four attitude functions: (1) Utilitarian: Attitudes that help maximize rewards and minimize punishments (Brand X preference for quality/value, avoiding a bad restaurant). (2) Knowledge: Attitudes that organize and simplify the world (political opinions making sense of complexity, party affiliation as simplifying heuristic). (3) Ego-defensive: Attitudes that protect against internal threats to self-esteem (disparaging academics due to intellectual insecurity, prejudice against immigrants driven by career inadequacy). (4) Value-expressive: Attitudes that express core values and identity (environmentalism as self-identity, religious moral views reflecting spiritual values). This framework is clinically important because effective attitude change requires targeting the function the attitude serves.",
