This prohibition recognizes the inherent power differential in educational and supervisory relationships and the potential for exploitation, impaired judgment, and harm to the student's training and career.

Teaching outdated diagnostic criteria when current criteria exist is inaccurate and could harm students' professional development and ultimately their future clients.
