Which of the following best describes the function of the Preamble within the overall structure of the Ethics Code?",

      "explanation": "The Preamble serves as the opening statement of the APA Ethics Code, articulating the profession's mission, values, and commitment to the welfare of those with whom psychologists work. It is neither enforceable like the Ethical Standards (A is incorrect) nor a replacement for the General Principles (C is incorrect). The Introduction and Applicability section, not the Preamble, defines the scope and application of the Code (D is incorrect).

      "explanation": "The Introduction and Applicability section clearly states that the Ethics Code applies to psychologists' activities that are part of their scientific, educational, or professional roles. Purely private conduct unrelated to these roles falls outside the Code's scope. Option A is incorrect because the Code explicitly limits its applicability to professional roles. Option C is incorrect because applicability is not determined by whether a complaint is filed. Option D represents a reasonable concern but overstates the Code's actual scope. However, if a psychologist's private behavior were to impair their professional competence or harm those with whom they work professionally, the Code could become applicable under standards such as 2.06.",

Only the Ethical Standards (the numbered sections 1 through 10) are enforceable rules that can form the basis for ethics complaints and disciplinary actions. Options A, C, and D all incorrectly assume that General Principles can serve as the basis for sanctions.

Option A is incorrect because the original 1953 code included enforceable provisions. Option B is inaccurate in its specifics, as the distinction between principles and standards evolved across multiple revisions.

Unlike most professional ethics codes that were written by committee, the original APA code was developed using a [BLANK2] approach in which members were asked to submit examples of ethical dilemmas they had encountered. The current version of the Ethics Code was adopted in [BLANK3]. A significant amendment in [BLANK4] addressed concerns about psychologists' participation in [BLANK5] by modifying Standard 1.02 to prevent the Ethics Code from being used to justify violations of human rights.",

The current version was adopted in 2002 with subsequent amendments. The 2010 amendment to Standard 1.02 was particularly significant, adding language clarifying that psychologists may never use the Ethics Code to justify or defend violating basic human rights, prompted by the Hoffman Report's documentation of psychologists' involvement in post-9/11 interrogation practices. The 2016 amendment further addressed Standard 3.04 regarding avoiding harm in these contexts.",
