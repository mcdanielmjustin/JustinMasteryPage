The treatment emphasizes that patients need to analyze their unconscious conflicts that drive their behaviors to make lasting change. DBT posits that borderline personality disorder results from a biological vulnerability to emotional dysregulation combined with an invalidating environment. Skills training teaches patients concrete behavioral skills in mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness.
