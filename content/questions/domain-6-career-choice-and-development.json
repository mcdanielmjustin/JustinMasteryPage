      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Holland's model defines differentiation as the degree to which a person's interest profile shows clear peaks (high scores on some types, low on others). Because Investigative and Enterprising are opposite on the hexagonal model, this pattern shows high differentiation. However, consistency refers to the relationship between a person's two highest types and whether they are adjacent on the hexagon. We cannot determine consistency without knowing the second-highest type. Thus the profile is differentiated, but consistency depends on the full arrangement of types.",
