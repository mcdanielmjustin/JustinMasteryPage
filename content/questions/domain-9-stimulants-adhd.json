      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta) is a dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that primarily enhances catecholamine signaling in the prefrontal cortex. This improves executive function, attention, and behavioral inhibition. The prefrontal cortex is hypothesized to be hypodopaminergic in ADHD, and stimulant medications address this deficit. Despite being a stimulant, the paradoxical calming effect occurs because the enhanced prefrontal function improves top-down cognitive control. It does not sedate, primarily affect serotonin, or work through GABA.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "While both methylphenidate and amphetamines block dopamine (DAT) and norepinephrine (NET) reuptake transporters, amphetamines have an additional mechanism: they enter the presynaptic terminal via DAT/NET and promote the release of dopamine and norepinephrine from vesicles through reverse transport (causing the transporter to work in reverse). This dual mechanism (reuptake blockade + vesicular release) makes amphetamines more potent dopamine/norepinephrine enhancers than methylphenidate. Amphetamines also weakly inhibit monoamine oxidase. This greater potency may explain why some patients who do not respond to methylphenidate do respond to amphetamines, and vice versa.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) is a prodrug in which dextroamphetamine is covalently bound to the amino acid lysine. After oral administration, the lysine moiety must be enzymatically cleaved in the blood (by red blood cell enzymes) to release active dextroamphetamine. This rate-limited conversion produces a more gradual onset and longer duration of action (up to 14 hours). The prodrug design reduces abuse potential because intranasal insufflation or intravenous injection does not bypass the rate-limiting enzymatic step. However, it does NOT completely eliminate abuse potential (A is false). It releases dextroamphetamine, not methylphenidate (C), and it acts in the prefrontal cortex like other stimulants (D).",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that blocks the norepinephrine transporter (NET) in the prefrontal cortex. Because the prefrontal cortex has limited dopamine transporters (DAT) and relies on NET to clear both norepinephrine and dopamine, atomoxetine effectively increases both catecholamines in the prefrontal cortex without significantly affecting the nucleus accumbens (reward pathway). This selectivity means atomoxetine has minimal abuse potential, is not a controlled substance, and does not produce euphoria.

      "explanation": "Stimulant advantages: Immediate onset (item1) allows same-day symptom assessment and dose adjustment, unlike non-stimulants requiring weeks. Larger effect sizes (item3) make stimulants more effective for core ADHD symptoms. Multiple formulations (item5) from 3-hour to 14-hour coverage allow personalization. Extensive evidence base (item7) spanning 60+ years. Stimulant disadvantages: Controlled substance status (item2) creates prescribing barriers. Appetite/growth/insomnia side effects (item4) are more common than with non-stimulants. Diversion risk (item6) is significant, particularly among college students. Rebound effects (item8) occur as short-acting formulations wear off.",
