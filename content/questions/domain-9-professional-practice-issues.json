      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Approximately 4-5 half-lives are needed to reach steady-state concentration, at which point drug input (absorption) equals drug output (elimination) at a constant rate. At 4 half-lives, approximately 94% of steady state is achieved; at 5 half-lives, approximately 97%. This principle is clinically critical: for a drug with a 24-hour half-life (e.g., fluoxetine's active metabolite norfluoxetine has ~4-16 day half-life), steady state may not be reached for weeks. This explains why therapeutic effects of many psychotropic medications are delayed and why dose adjustments should be spaced appropriately to allow steady-state assessment.",

After oral administration, drugs are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the portal circulation, which delivers blood directly to the liver before it enters systemic circulation. The liver's cytochrome P450 enzymes (especially CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19) metabolize a portion of the drug before it reaches the rest of the body, reducing its bioavailability. Some drugs have very high first-pass metabolism (e.g., oral naltrexone has ~5-40% bioavailability).

      "explanation": "Azole antifungals (ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole) are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, one of the most important cytochrome P450 enzymes for psychotropic drug metabolism. CYP3A4 metabolizes many benzodiazepines (alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam), certain antidepressants, and many other medications. When a CYP3A4 inhibitor is added, it blocks the metabolism of these substrates, causing their blood levels to rise and potentially producing toxicity or excessive sedation. This is a pharmacokinetic interaction (affecting drug levels), distinct from a pharmacodynamic interaction (affecting drug effects at the receptor).

These are compounded by lack of perceived benefit, especially when medications treat negative symptoms poorly or when patients have limited insight.

(B) First-pass metabolism occurs when orally administered drugs are partially metabolized by the liver before reaching systemic circulation, reducing bioavailability; IV administration bypasses this. (C) CYP450 enzymes, especially CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2C19, metabolize most psychotropic medications, making drug interactions via enzyme inhibition or induction clinically significant. (D) is incorrect: highly protein-bound drugs have LESS free drug available to cross the blood-brain barrier, as only unbound (free) drug is pharmacologically active.

(B) SSRIs typically take 4-6 weeks to achieve full therapeutic effect for depression because downstream receptor adaptations and neuroplastic changes must occur beyond initial serotonin reuptake blockade. (C) Buspirone is a benzodiazepine derivative that produces immediate anxiolytic effects and carries significant abuse potential. (D) Carbamazepine is a mood stabilizer that requires blood level monitoring partly because it induces its own metabolism through hepatic enzyme autoinduction, necessitating dosage adjustments over time. (E) Tricyclic antidepressants are first-line treatments for depression due to their favorable side effect profile and wide therapeutic index. (F) Venlafaxine (Effexor) is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that at lower doses primarily affects serotonin reuptake and at higher doses increasingly inhibits norepinephrine reuptake as well.",

(D) Carbamazepine does undergo autoinduction of CYP3A4, meaning it accelerates its own metabolism over 2-4 weeks, requiring dose increases and blood level monitoring. (F) Venlafaxine does have dose-dependent dual reuptake inhibition; at lower doses (~75mg) it acts primarily as an SSRI, with norepinephrine reuptake inhibition becoming significant at higher doses (~150-225mg+). The incorrect statements: (A) Benzodiazepines enhance GABA-A function (not dopamine reuptake); (C) Buspirone is a 5-HT1A partial agonist (not a benzodiazepine), has delayed onset, and has low abuse potential; (E) TCAs are NOT first-line (they have unfavorable side effects and narrow therapeutic index making them dangerous in overdose).",
