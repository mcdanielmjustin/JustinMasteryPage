      "explanation": "This presentation is classic narcolepsy Type 1 with cataplexy (muscle weakness with emotion) and sleep-onset REM periods. Research has established that narcolepsy Type 1 results from loss of orexin (hypocretin)-producing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, likely due to autoimmune destruction. CSF orexin levels are typically very low or undetectable in these patients.",
