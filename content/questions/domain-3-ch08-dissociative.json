      "stem": "A patient reports episodes lasting hours where she finds herself in unfamiliar locations with no memory of traveling there. She has extensive unexplained time gaps in her daily life. During evaluation, she displays shifts in behavior, voice, and stated preferences that she doesn't recall. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The combination of identity disruption (behavior/voice shifts), amnesia for daily life, and finding herself in unknown locations without memory indicates DID. The shifts she doesn't recall represent different identity states taking executive control. Dissociative fugue is now a specifier for dissociative amnesia. Depersonalization lacks the identity disruption and amnesia.",
