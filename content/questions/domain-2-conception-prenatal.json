      "explanation": "PKU is a classic example of gene-environment interaction. The genotype (homozygous recessive for the PKU allele) is fixed, but the phenotype (intellectual disability) can be prevented by modifying the environment (restricting phenylalanine in the diet). This demonstrates that genotype does not inevitably determine phenotype when environmental triggers are removed early.",

The embryonic period (weeks 3-8) is the most critical because organogenesis is occurring and all major organ systems are forming.
