The TRAP symptoms (Tremor, Rigidity, Akinesia/Bradykinesia, Postural instability) result from this dopamine deficit. ACh deficit in the nucleus basalis is associated with Alzheimer's disease. GABA deficit in the caudate describes Huntington's pathology. Serotonin deficit in the raphe nuclei is linked to depression.",
