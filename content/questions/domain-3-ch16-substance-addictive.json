      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "CIWA-Ar of 16 indicates moderate withdrawal requiring medical management. Given his heavy, prolonged use and current moderate withdrawal, inpatient medical admission with symptom-triggered benzodiazepine protocol is appropriate to prevent progression to severe withdrawal, seizures, or delirium tremens. Waiting for seizures is dangerous; outpatient would be inadequate for this severity.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Buprenorphine (a partial agonist) can precipitate withdrawal if administered when full agonist is still on receptors. Traditional induction requires waiting until moderate withdrawal (COWS ≥12) to ensure sufficient receptor clearance.
