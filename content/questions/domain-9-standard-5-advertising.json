      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Standard 5.01 prohibits psychologists from making false, deceptive, or fraudulent statements about their work. A claim of 95% success rate based on uncontrolled self-reports is misleading because it implies scientific rigor without a valid evidence base. Subjective client reports without standardized outcome measures, control conditions, or systematic data collection do not support such a specific claim.
