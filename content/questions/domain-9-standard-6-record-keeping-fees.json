      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Standard 6.04 requires that fee arrangements be discussed as early as feasible in the professional relationship. When financial difficulties arise, the ethical approach is to discuss options openly: sliding scale, reduced fee, payment plans, or referral to lower-cost providers. Termination solely for inability to pay without exploring alternatives would be harmful. Ignoring the issue creates tension and boundary problems. Bartering (accepting goods/services) requires careful consideration under Standard 6.05.",
