      "explanation": "The Dutton and Aron (1974) bridge study is a classic demonstration of the Schachter-Singer two-factor theory, specifically the concept of misattribution of arousal. Men on the suspension bridge experienced physiological arousal from fear, but in the presence of an attractive experimenter, they misattributed that arousal to romantic attraction. This supports the two-factor theory's claim that emotion requires both arousal and a cognitive label, and that the same arousal can be interpreted as different emotions depending on context.",

      "explanation": "The Yerkes-Dodson law describes an inverted-U relationship between arousal and performance, with a critical nuance: the optimal arousal level depends on task complexity. For complex or novel tasks (like learning new statistics), lower arousal levels are optimal. For simple or well-practiced tasks, higher arousal levels are optimal. High test anxiety (excessive arousal) would specifically impair performance on the complex task. Option B is the common misconception -- the peak does not always occur at moderate levels.",
