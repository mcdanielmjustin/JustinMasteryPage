      "explanation": "Herzberg's (1959) two-factor theory proposes that satisfaction and dissatisfaction are not opposite ends of one continuum but rather two separate dimensions. Motivators (achievement, recognition, work itself, responsibility, advancement) produce satisfaction when present but not dissatisfaction when absent. Hygiene factors (salary, supervision, working conditions, company policy, interpersonal relations) produce dissatisfaction when inadequate but not satisfaction when adequate. Critics argue the theory is method-dependent (supported mainly with critical incident methodology) and oversimplifies the satisfaction construct, but it has been highly influential in job redesign efforts.",

(2) A motivational process—job resources (autonomy, social support, feedback, development opportunities) fulfill basic psychological needs, leading to engagement and positive outcomes. The model is flexible because specific demands and resources vary across jobs, but the dual process applies universally.
