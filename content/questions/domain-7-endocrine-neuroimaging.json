      "explanation": "This presentation is classic for hypothyroidism mimicking major depressive disorder. Hypothyroidism produces depression, cognitive slowing, fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The laboratory pattern is elevated TSH (because the pituitary is trying to stimulate the underactive thyroid) with low free T4. Thyroid dysfunction is one of the most common medical mimics of psychiatric disorders, and thyroid screening (TSH and free T4) should be performed for new-onset depression, particularly in women over 40.",
