      "explanation": "This meets criteria for schizophrenia: >6 months of active symptoms including hallucinations, disorganized speech, and negative symptoms (diminished expression, avolition). The 2-week depressive episode was present for a minority of the total illness duration, which is insufficient for schizoaffective disorder (requires major mood episodes for majority of total duration).",

      "explanation": "ANC of 950/μL falls in the 'moderate neutropenia' range (500-999/μL).
