      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Vroom's (1964) VIE (Valence-Instrumentality-Expectancy) theory is a process theory that proposes: Expectancy (E)—the belief that effort will lead to successful performance (probability 0-1); Instrumentality (I)—the belief that performance will lead to specific outcomes (probability -1 to +1); Valence (V)—the desirability or value of those outcomes (positive, negative, or neutral). Motivation = E x I x V. If any component is zero, motivation is zero. This multiplicative relationship means organizations must address all three—effort-performance links, performance-reward links, and reward attractiveness.

      "explanation": "Locke and Latham's (1990, 2002) goal-setting theory is one of the most robustly supported theories in I/O psychology. Specific, difficult goals produce higher performance than easy goals, vague goals, or 'do your best' instructions. The mechanisms are: direction (focus attention), effort (energize), persistence, and strategy development. Key moderators include: goal commitment (must accept the goal), feedback (must know progress), task complexity (goals are less effective for complex, novel tasks), and self-efficacy. Impossible goals reduce performance and motivation—goals must be challenging but attainable. Research support exceeds 90% in controlled studies.",

When rewards are perceived as controlling, they undermine intrinsic motivation by shifting perceived locus of causality from internal to external—the person feels they're performing for the reward rather than for enjoyment. When perceived as informational (conveying competence), rewards can maintain or enhance intrinsic motivation. The 'overjustification effect' occurs when tangible, expected, contingent rewards undermine intrinsic interest in tasks that were initially intrinsically motivating.",
