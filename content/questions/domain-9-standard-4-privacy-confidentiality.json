      "explanation": "Standard 4.05(b)(3) permits disclosure of confidential information without consent when mandated by law to protect the client or others from harm. All states have mandatory child abuse reporting laws that require psychologists (as mandated reporters) to report suspected child abuse. This legal mandate takes precedence over confidentiality. The psychologist must report to child protective services regardless of whether the child is the identified client. Waiting or confronting the alleged abuser could endanger the child.",
