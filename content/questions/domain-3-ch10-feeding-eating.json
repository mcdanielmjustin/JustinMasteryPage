      "explanation": "With a BMI of 15.2 and bradycardia at 42 bpm, this patient meets criteria for medical instability requiring immediate inpatient hospitalization. Bradycardia below 50 bpm is a marker of severe malnutrition and cardiac compromise. Despite patient refusal, involuntary hospitalization is indicated when medical compromise poses imminent risk to life. The other options are inappropriate for this level of acuity.",
