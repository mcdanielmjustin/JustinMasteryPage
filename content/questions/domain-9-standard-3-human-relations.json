Not all multiple relationships are avoidable (especially in small communities or military settings), and the standard acknowledges that not all multiple relationships are harmful.

The power differential inherent in the supervisor-supervisee relationship heightens the severity. Physical contact is not required; repeated sexually suggestive comments constitute verbal conduct of a sexual nature.
