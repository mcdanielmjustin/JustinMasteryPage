      "explanation": "Fiedler's contingency model proposes that leader effectiveness depends on the match between leadership style and situational control (determined by leader-member relations, task structure, and position power). Low-LPC (task-oriented) leaders are most effective in situations of very high control (favorable—good relations, structured task, strong power) or very low control (unfavorable). High-LPC (relationship-oriented) leaders are most effective in moderate control situations. Critically, Fiedler believed leadership style is relatively fixed, so the situation should be changed to fit the leader, not vice versa ('leader match').",

The theory identifies four leader behaviors (directive, supportive, participative, achievement-oriented) and prescribes which is most effective based on subordinate characteristics (need for autonomy, experience, locus of control) and environmental factors (task structure, formal authority system, work group).

A critical finding is that these dimensions are independent (D)—a leader can be high on both, low on both, or any combination.
