      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Lewin's (1947) change model has three stages: Unfreezing—disrupting the current equilibrium by creating motivation for change (through disconfirmation, survival anxiety, or reducing learning anxiety); Changing (Moving)—introducing new attitudes, behaviors, and processes; Refreezing—stabilizing the new state through reinforcement, policies, and new norms. Schein later elaborated on this model, adding cognitive restructuring through identification and scanning as part of the changing stage. Option A describes Tuckman's group development stages.",

      "explanation": "Action research (Lewin) is a cyclical process combining research and practice: problems are diagnosed through data collection, interventions are planned and implemented, outcomes are measured, and findings feed back into the next cycle of diagnosis and action. Key features include: collaboration between researcher and organizational members, emphasis on practical problem-solving, participative approaches, and iterative learning. This approach is foundational to OD because it embeds evaluation into the change process and treats change as an ongoing learning cycle rather than a one-time event.",

AI is based on the social constructionist assumption that organizations move in the direction of what they study—asking positive questions generates positive change.
