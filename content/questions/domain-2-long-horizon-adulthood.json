OPTIMIZATION\u2014practicing the selected pieces more frequently and intensively to achieve the highest possible quality within chosen domains. COMPENSATION\u2014slowing down before fast passages to create a perceptual contrast that made fast sections appear faster than they were, and using tempo manipulation as an alternative strategy to maintain perceived virtuosity despite reduced motor speed.",

Vascular dementia: stepwise decline following cerebrovascular events (strokes), associated with cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes), white matter lesions on imaging. Frontotemporal dementia: typically younger onset (ages 45\u201365), prominent personality and behavioral changes (disinhibition, apathy, impulsivity) PRECEDING memory loss, frontal and temporal lobe atrophy.
