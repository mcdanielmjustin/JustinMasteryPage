Wait—at 19 with 6 inattention and 4 H-I, she has 6≥5 for inattention but only 4<5 for H-I, so it's still Inattentive presentation at age 19 as well. Let me reconsider—actually the answer key shows Combined for the adult, which would require her to have at least 5 H-I symptoms. The question says she has 4 H-I symptoms currently as a child, but the adult scenario asks about 'same symptom count' which would still be 4 H-I.
