      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Kirkpatrick's (1959, 1994) four levels: Level 1 (Reaction)—how trainees felt about the training (satisfaction, relevance). Level 2 (Learning)—what was actually learned (knowledge, skills, attitudes gained). Level 3 (Behavior/Transfer)—whether learned skills are applied on the job. Level 4 (Results)—organizational outcomes (productivity, quality, costs, profits). Level 3 (behavior transfer) is particularly critical because it addresses the 'transfer problem'—research suggests that only 10-20% of training content transfers to the job. Transfer is influenced by the training design, trainee characteristics, and the work environment.",

The more the training situation mirrors the actual work situation (high physical and psychological fidelity), the more likely skills will transfer. This principle underlies the use of simulators (flight training), role plays, and on-the-job training. However, the theory is limited because it doesn't account for transfer through understanding principles—Judd's (1908) principle-based transfer theory argues that teaching underlying principles promotes broader, more flexible transfer.",
