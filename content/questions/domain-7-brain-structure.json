      "explanation": "This presentation is classic Wernicke's aphasia (receptive/fluent aphasia): fluent but meaningless speech, impaired comprehension, and anosognosia for the deficit. Wernicke's area is located in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann area 22). Broca's area damage (option A) produces nonfluent, effortful speech with preserved comprehension. Arcuate fasciculus damage (option C) produces conduction aphasia with intact fluency and comprehension but impaired repetition.
