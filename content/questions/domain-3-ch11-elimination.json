      "stem": "A 7-year-old boy presents with primary nocturnal enuresis occurring 4-5 nights per week. Physical examination and urinalysis are normal. His parents have tried fluid restriction and scheduled voiding without success. What is the first-line treatment recommendation?",
      "options": [
        "Desmopressin (DDAVP) nightly",
        "Enuresis alarm (bell-and-pad)",
        "Imipramine at bedtime",
        "Bladder training exercises"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The enuresis alarm (bell-and-pad method) is the first-line treatment for primary nocturnal enuresis due to its superior long-term cure rates (approximately 65-75%) compared to pharmacological interventions. While desmopressin provides faster relief, it has higher relapse rates upon discontinuation. Imipramine is third-line due to cardiac risks. The alarm conditions arousal to bladder fullness.",

      "explanation": "Evidence-based treatment for retentive encopresis includes: disimpaction to clear the rectum, maintenance laxatives to prevent re-accumulation, scheduled toilet sitting (utilizing gastrocolic reflex), and dietary modifications. Punishment for accidents is contraindicated as it increases anxiety, shame, and treatment resistance while worsening the condition.",
