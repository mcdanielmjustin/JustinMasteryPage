Dr. Martinez should invoke privilege on James's behalf and refuse to disclose confidential therapy communications.

This means clients retain the right to waive privilege and allow disclosure if they choose to do so.

A reviewer could theoretically maintain confidentiality while still improperly using ideas, so these are distinct ethical duties requiring separate compliance.","legacy_domain_code":"ETH","legacy_domain_name":"Ethics, Legal, and Professional Issues"},{"id":"JQ-ETH-054-example_recognition","source_question_id":"054","source_exam":"Exam 7","source_question_number":218,"source_summary":"A psychologist who is reviewing a research paper submitted to a professional journal cannot use the unique ideas and procedures presented in the paper in their own research without obtaining permission from the paper's authors, as this would violate the authors' proprietary rights.","domain_code":"PETH","domain_name":"Psychopharmacology & Ethics","subdomain":"APA Ethics Code Overview and Standards 7 & 8","angle":"example_recognition","question":"Which of the following scenarios best illustrates a violation of the ethical principle protecting proprietary rights during peer review?","options":{"A":"A reviewer reads a manuscript describing a statistical analysis technique, discusses the general concept with colleagues in casual conversation, but does not conduct independent research using that technique","B":"A reviewer attends a conference where the manuscript's author presents preliminary findings and takes notes on the methodology for general educational purposes","C":"A reviewer reads a manuscript describing a novel assessment instrument with a specific scoring algorithm, then develops and publishes a research study using that identical instrument and algorithm without contacting the authors","D":"A reviewer carefully studies the theoretical framework presented in a manuscript and incorporates those same theoretical concepts into their own theoretical paper with appropriate citations"},"correct_answer":"C","explanation":"This scenario represents a clear violation because the reviewer is directly appropriating the authors' specific, unique intellectual property (the assessment instrument and its scoring method) for independent research without permission or acknowledgment of the source. While discussion and education are generally permissible, developing and publishing original research using the authors' proprietary procedures crosses an ethical line without securing authorization.","legacy_domain_code":"ETH","legacy_domain_name":"Ethics, Legal, and Professional Issues"},{"id":"JQ-ETH-054-implication","source_question_id":"054","source_exam":"Exam 7","source_question_number":218,"source_summary":"A psychologist who is reviewing a research paper submitted to a professional journal cannot use the unique ideas and procedures presented in the paper in their own research without obtaining permission from the paper's authors, as this would violate the authors' proprietary rights.","domain_code":"PETH","domain_name":"Psychopharmacology & Ethics","subdomain":"APA Ethics Code Overview and Standards 7 & 8","angle":"implication","question":"A psychologist reviews a manuscript containing a unique intervention protocol and later decides against pursuing research using this approach. However, the psychologist mentions the protocol's key elements in a teaching lecture and provides students with the manuscript reference. Why might this action still raise ethical concerns despite the psychologist's non-competitive intent?","options":{"A":"Because discussing and disseminating the authors' unique ideas to students without permission may facilitate unauthorized use of proprietary content, potentially violating the authors' intellectual property rights even though the reviewer did not directly use the ideas in research","B":"Because faculty members are held to different ethical standards than researchers and are permitted broader latitude in discussing others' unpublished work in educational contexts","C":"Because providing references in educational settings constitutes plagiarism, regardless of whether citation is included","D":"Because the APA Ethics Code prohibits any mention of reviewed manuscripts in any context outside of the peer review process"},"correct_answer":"A","explanation":"The ethical obligation to respect proprietary rights encompasses more than just the reviewer's direct use; it includes preventing unauthorized dissemination that could facilitate others' misappropriation of the authors' ideas. Although teaching and citing sources are generally appropriate, detailed discussion of unique procedures risks compromising the authors' ability to control and benefit from their intellectual property. The reviewer should consider whether such disclosure is necessary for educational purposes or whether permission should be sought first.","legacy_domain_code":"ETH","legacy_domain_name":"Ethics, Legal, and Professional Issues"}]}
