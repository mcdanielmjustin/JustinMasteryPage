This contrasts with efficacy studies, which use random assignment to maximize internal validity. This distinction is a core differentiator between the two study types on the EPPP."

This is the second largest contributor after extratherapeutic factors (~40%), and is commonly tested because it is frequently confused with the ~15% contributions of expectancy/placebo effects and specific techniques."
