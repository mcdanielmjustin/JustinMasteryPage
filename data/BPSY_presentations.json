            "A": "Dopamine agonists are non-selective — they enhance dopamine in both the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic pathways, and mesolimbic excess causes psychosis",

          "correct_answer": "A",
          "explanation": "Dopamine agonists are not pathway-selective. The nigrostriatal pathway (substantia nigra → striatum) is depleted in Parkinson's, causing motor symptoms; dopaminergic stimulation of this pathway improves movement. However, the same drugs also stimulate the mesolimbic pathway (VTA → nucleus accumbens/limbic system), where dopamine excess is the leading neurochemical hypothesis for psychosis. This creates a pharmacological dilemma: treating motor symptoms risks inducing psychiatric side effects via mesolimbic overdrive.",
          "distractor_rationale": {
            "B": "Serotonin depletion is not the mechanism — pramipexole acts primarily at D2/D3 dopamine receptors, not on serotonergic systems.",
            "C": "No evidence supports a 'cognitive resource redistribution' mechanism. Hallucinations are a direct neurochemical effect, not an indirect consequence of motor improvement.",
            "D": "Glutamate receptor activation is not the primary mechanism of dopamine agonist side effects. The NMDA/glutamate hypothesis is associated with ketamine/PCP-induced psychosis, not dopamine agonists."

          "correct_answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Most antipsychotics work by blocking D2 receptors. In Parkinson's patients, D2 blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway worsens motor symptoms (the same pathway the dopamine agonist is trying to support). Quetiapine and clozapine have very low D2 receptor affinity, making them far less likely to exacerbate parkinsonism while still reducing mesolimbic dopamine excess. Clozapine has the strongest evidence for PD psychosis; quetiapine is often used first due to easier monitoring. Typical antipsychotics are contraindicated.",
          "distractor_rationale": {
            "A": "Haloperidol is a high-potency D2 blocker — it would dramatically worsen Parkinson's motor symptoms by blocking the very pathway that needs dopaminergic support.",
            "B": "Risperidone has intermediate D2 affinity and clinically worsens parkinsonism in PD patients — it is considered unsafe for this population.",
            "D": "Aripiprazole's partial D2 agonism theoretically sounds appealing, but clinical evidence shows it can destabilize motor symptoms in PD; it is generally avoided in this population."

Slow-wave sleep (SWS/Stage N3) dominates the first third of the night (homeostatic recovery), while REM sleep cycles extend and become more dominant in the final third (approximately 4–6 AM). Psychological stress activates the HPA axis, elevating cortisol, which is a potent REM suppressant and arousal activator. Because the 3–5 AM window is REM-dominant, stress hormones preferentially disrupt this stage, causing awakening. This also explains why the patient's 'second wind' emerges in the late afternoon — cortisol follows a diurnal pattern.",

Rules include: use the bed only for sleep and sex; get out of bed if unable to sleep within 20 minutes; return only when sleepy; maintain consistent wake times.
