      "explanation": "The passage was modified to say sleep spindles are generated by the 'hypothalamus,' but this is incorrect. Sleep spindles are generated by the thalamus, specifically through interactions between thalamic reticular nucleus neurons and thalamocortical neurons. The hypothalamus is involved in regulating sleep-wake cycles (e.g., via the suprachiasmatic nucleus and orexin/hypocretin neurons) but does not generate sleep spindles.

      "explanation": "The passage reverses the relationship between MZ and DZ concordance rates. When MZ (monozygotic/identical twin) concordance is substantially HIGHER than DZ (dizygotic/fraternal twin) concordance, this implicates genetic factors, because MZ twins share 100% of their genes while DZ twins share approximately 50%. A higher concordance rate among MZ twins compared to DZ twins suggests that the greater genetic similarity is contributing to the trait or condition in question."

      "explanation": "The passage was modified to say that procedural memory and priming are 'often impaired' in anterograde amnesia, when in fact they are 'often preserved.' This is a well-established finding in neuropsychology: patients with anterograde amnesia (such as the famous patient H.M.) cannot form new explicit/declarative memories, but their implicit memory systems—including procedural memory and priming—remain largely intact. This dissociation provides key evidence for the distinction between explicit and implicit memory systems."

      "correct_option_index": 2,
      "explanation": "The passage incorrectly refers to neurotransmitters being released into the 'synaptic vesicle.' Synaptic vesicles are the small membrane-bound sacs within the terminal buttons that store neurotransmitters before release. Neurotransmitters are actually released into the synaptic cleft, which is the small gap between the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. This is a subtle substitution because synaptic vesicles are closely related structures involved in the same process, but they serve a different function (storage vs. the space into which neurotransmitters are released)."

      "correct_option_index": 1,
      "explanation": "The passage introduced an error by replacing 'subventricular zone' with 'subgranular zone.' The two confirmed sites of adult neurogenesis in the brain are the hippocampus (specifically the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus) and the subventricular zone (SVZ), which supplies new neurons to the olfactory bulb. The term 'subgranular zone' is a real neuroanatomical term (it refers to the neurogenic niche within the hippocampus itself), making this a subtle but clearly incorrect substitution when paired with the olfactory bulb. The correct pairing is olfactory bulb/subventricular zone."

      "explanation": "The Wada test is primarily used to lateralize language (and sometimes memory as a secondary function), but its defining and most well-known purpose is to determine which hemisphere is dominant for language. The passage incorrectly substituted 'memory' for 'language.' While the Wada test can provide information about memory lateralization, its primary and classic purpose—and the one most relevant for the EPPP—is language lateralization. The other options describe changes that were not actually made: the test does anesthetize (not stimulate) one hemisphere, and it is indeed being replaced by fMRI (not PET scans)."

      "explanation": "The passage reverses the effect of a distractor task on the serial position curve. Research consistently shows that a distractor task (such as counting backward) eliminates the recency effect — because items at the end of the list are displaced from short-term memory — but does not eliminate the primacy effect, since those items have already been rehearsed and encoded into long-term memory.

'Aplasia' refers to a failure of an organ or tissue to develop or to function normally, and is not the accepted terminology in this context.

This is a central tenet of his theory — the cognitive evaluation of a stimulus precedes and determines the emotional response. The passage reversed this temporal relationship by stating appraisal comes 'after' emotion instead of 'before.' Note that Zajonc, not Lazarus, argued that emotion could precede cognition, making this reversal a particularly important distinction for the EPPP."
