      "question": "What is the difference between an agonist and an antagonist of a neurotransmitter?",
      "answer": "An agonist mimics or enhances the effects of a neurotransmitter by binding to and activating its receptor, thereby producing the same physiological response as the neurotransmitter. An antagonist binds to the receptor but blocks or inhibits the neurotransmitter's effects without activating it, reducing the neurotransmitter's action.",

      "question": "What is the difference between GABA and glutamate as neurotransmitters?",
      "answer": "GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is the brain's primary inhibitory neurotransmitter; it reduces neural excitability and produces calming effects. Disruption of GABA activity is associated with anxiety disorders, and benzodiazepines work by potentiating GABA. Glutamate is the brain's primary excitatory neurotransmitter; it increases neural excitability and plays a central role in learning and memory via long-term potentiation (LTP). Excessive glutamate can be neurotoxic (excitotoxicity).",

      "question": "What is the difference between the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system?",
      "answer": "The sympathetic nervous system mediates the 'fight-or-flight' response: it increases heart rate, dilates pupils, inhibits digestion, and releases epinephrine/norepinephrine. The parasympathetic nervous system mediates the 'rest-and-digest' response: it decreases heart rate, constricts pupils, promotes digestion, and releases acetylcholine. The two systems are generally antagonistic and work together to maintain homeostasis.",
      "key_distinction": "Sympathetic = arousal/emergency; Parasympathetic = restoration/calm.",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Students often confuse which system uses acetylcholine — both do at different junctions, but the parasympathetic is primarily cholinergic.",

      "answer": "Broca's aphasia results from damage to Broca's area in the left frontal lobe. Speech is nonfluent, labored, and telegraphic, but comprehension is largely intact. The patient knows what they want to say but cannot produce it fluently. Wernicke's aphasia results from damage to Wernicke's area in the left temporal lobe. Speech is fluent but contains paraphasias, neologisms, and word substitutions ('word salad'); comprehension is severely impaired. The patient speaks easily but cannot understand language or recognize their own errors.",

      "question": "What is the difference between the emotional effects of left vs. right hemisphere cortical damage?",
      "answer": "Damage to the left hemisphere is more likely to produce depression or emotional volatility — often called the 'catastrophic reaction.' This may be due to disruption of left hemisphere involvement in positive affect and approach motivation. Damage to the right hemisphere is more likely to produce indifference, euphoria, or inappropriate affect — sometimes called 'la belle indifférence' — and is associated with anosognosia (denial/unawareness of deficits) and contralateral neglect (especially right parietal damage).",

      "question": "What is the difference between contralateral neglect and anosognosia?",
      "answer": "Contralateral neglect (hemispatial neglect) is a failure to attend to, perceive, or respond to stimuli on the side of space opposite the brain lesion — most commonly left-side neglect from right parietal damage. The patient shaves only the right side of their face or eats only the food on the right side of the plate. Anosognosia is a lack of awareness or denial of one's own disability or illness, also most commonly caused by right parietal lobe damage. A patient with anosognosia may deny they have hemiplegia when it is obvious to observers.",
      "key_distinction": "Contralateral neglect = failure to attend to one side of space; Anosognosia = unawareness of one's own disability.",

      "question": "What is the difference between the roles of the hippocampus and the amygdala in memory?",
      "answer": "The hippocampus is essential for the formation of new long-term declarative memories (both episodic and semantic). Damage to the hippocampus results in anterograde amnesia (inability to form new explicit memories). The amygdala is central to the formation and consolidation of emotional memories, especially fear-related memories. It modulates memory storage in other areas based on emotional significance. Key distinction: the hippocampus processes what happened; the amygdala attaches emotional meaning and intensity to those memories.",
      "key_distinction": "Hippocampus = declarative memory formation; Amygdala = emotional memory consolidation.",

      "item_y": "Hypothalamus",
      "question": "What is the difference between the thalamus and the hypothalamus?",
      "answer": "The thalamus acts as the brain's primary sensory relay station, routing incoming sensory information (all senses except olfaction) to the appropriate areas of the cerebral cortex. It sits at the top of the brainstem. The hypothalamus regulates the four F's (feeding, fighting, fleeing, and sexual behavior), body temperature, circadian rhythms, and the endocrine system through control of the pituitary gland. It lies below the thalamus and has extensive connections to the endocrine and autonomic nervous systems.",

      "question": "What is the difference between the cerebellum and the basal ganglia in motor function?",
      "answer": "The cerebellum coordinates smooth, precise voluntary movement, balance, and motor learning. Damage to the cerebellum produces ataxia, slurred speech, and symptoms resembling intoxication — as seen after skateboarding accidents affecting the cerebellum. The basal ganglia are involved in the initiation, regulation, and modulation of voluntary movement, procedural learning, and habit formation. Damage is associated with movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (dopamine deficit) and Huntington's disease (GABA/glutamate abnormalities).",
      "key_distinction": "Cerebellum = coordination and balance; Basal ganglia = movement initiation and modulation.",

      "item_y": "Cannon-Bard theory",
      "question": "What is the difference between the James-Lange and Cannon-Bard theories of emotion?",
      "answer": "The James-Lange theory proposes that emotions follow physiological arousal: a stimulus triggers a bodily response (e.g., running), and the perception of that bodily state produces the subjective emotional experience (e.g., fear). The emotion is the interpretation of the body's reaction. The Cannon-Bard theory proposes that the physiological response and the subjective emotional experience occur simultaneously and independently, not in sequence. Cannon critiqued James-Lange by showing that the same bodily state can accompany different emotions.",
      "key_distinction": "James-Lange = body reaction causes emotion (sequential); Cannon-Bard = body and emotion occur simultaneously.",

      "item_y": "Schachter-Singer two-factor theory",
      "question": "What is the difference between the Cannon-Bard and Schachter-Singer theories of emotion?",
      "answer": "The Cannon-Bard theory holds that the body and the emotion are activated simultaneously and independently. The Schachter-Singer (two-factor) theory proposes that emotion requires two components: undifferentiated physiological arousal and a cognitive label. All emotions produce the same general arousal; the label we attach (based on situational context) determines which specific emotion we experience. This explains misattribution of arousal — if arousal from one source is attributed to another, the experienced emotion changes (e.g., bridge study).",
      "key_distinction": "Cannon-Bard = simultaneous, independent body and feeling; Schachter-Singer = arousal + cognitive label = emotion.",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Both involve physiological arousal and subjective emotion occurring together, but Schachter-Singer adds the critical cognitive labeling step.",

      "item_y": "Secondary appraisal",
      "question": "What is the difference between primary appraisal and secondary appraisal in Lazarus's cognitive appraisal theory of stress?",
      "answer": "In Lazarus's theory, primary appraisal involves evaluating whether an event is irrelevant, benign/positive, or stressful (threatening, harmful, or challenging). It answers: 'Does this matter to me?' Secondary appraisal occurs after an event is perceived as stressful; it involves evaluating one's available coping resources and options. It answers: 'What can I do about it?' Together these determine the nature and intensity of the stress response.",

      "question": "What is the difference between REM and NREM sleep?",
      "answer": "REM (rapid eye movement) sleep is characterized by desynchronized, low-amplitude brain activity similar to wakefulness, rapid eye movements, skeletal muscle atonia, vivid dreaming, and memory consolidation for procedural and emotional memories. NREM sleep is divided into three stages (N1, N2, N3) and is characterized by high-amplitude, low-frequency (slow) brain waves. NREM is associated with physical restoration and declarative memory consolidation. Slow-wave sleep (N3, deep NREM) is dominant early in the night; REM periods lengthen as the night progresses. Sleepwalking and sleep terrors occur during NREM.",

      "question": "What is the difference between anterograde amnesia and retrograde amnesia?",
      "answer": "Anterograde amnesia is the inability to form new long-term memories after the onset of a brain injury or illness. The person cannot remember anything that happens after the injury, though their memories from before are often intact. It is typically caused by hippocampal damage. Retrograde amnesia is the loss of memories that were formed before the onset of injury or illness. When retrograde amnesia is present, recently acquired memories are typically lost before older, more consolidated memories (Ribot's law).",

      "answer": "Advanced sleep phase involves falling asleep and waking up significantly earlier than conventional sleep times (e.g., sleeping from 7 PM to 3 AM). It is most common in older adults. Delayed sleep phase involves falling asleep and waking up significantly later than conventional times (e.g., sleeping from 3 AM to noon). It is most common in adolescents and young adults. Both are classified as circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders.",

      "question": "What is the difference between structural and functional neuroimaging techniques?",
      "answer": "Structural neuroimaging produces static images of the brain's anatomy and physical structure. CT scans use X-rays and are excellent for detecting acute hemorrhage rapidly. MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce high-resolution images of soft tissue structure. Functional neuroimaging captures brain activity and metabolism in real time. PET (positron emission tomography) measures glucose metabolism or blood flow using radioactive tracers. fMRI (functional MRI) measures the BOLD signal (blood oxygen level–dependent) reflecting neural activity. SPECT measures regional blood flow. CT is a structural technique — a common EPPP trap.",

Symptoms include fatigue, feeling cold, weight gain despite poor appetite, constipation, dry skin, cognitive slowing, and depression. It is treated with thyroid hormone replacement. Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) results in increased metabolic rate.

Secondary hypertension has an identifiable underlying medical cause such as renal disease, adrenal tumors, thyroid disorders, or medications.

      "answer": "SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) selectively block the reuptake of serotonin. They are better tolerated, have fewer anticholinergic and cardiac side effects, and are much safer in overdose than TCAs. Common side effects include sexual dysfunction, GI upset, and risk of serotonin syndrome. TCAs (tricyclic antidepressants) have a broader mechanism, blocking reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine as well as having significant anticholinergic, antihistaminic, and anti-adrenergic effects. They cause more side effects (dry mouth, constipation, orthostatic hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias) and are lethal in overdose. Secondary amine TCAs affect norepinephrine more; tertiary amines affect both serotonin and norepinephrine equally.",

They are effective for positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions) but have high risk of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), including tardive dyskinesia with long-term use. Atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics block both D2 dopamine and 5-HT2 serotonin receptors. They carry a lower risk of EPS and tardive dyskinesia but a higher risk of metabolic syndrome (weight gain, diabetes, dyslipidemia).

Benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, alprazolam, lorazepam) bind to a modulatory site on the GABA-A receptor and increase the frequency of chloride channel opening in the presence of GABA. They have a wide therapeutic index, making fatal overdose from benzodiazepines alone uncommon. They are the preferred class for treating anxiety, insomnia, seizures, and alcohol withdrawal. Barbiturates (e.g., phenobarbital, pentobarbital) bind to a different GABA-A site and directly increase the duration of chloride channel opening; at high doses they can activate the channel without GABA. Their narrow therapeutic index makes overdose and death much more likely, limiting their clinical use to specific seizure disorders and anesthesia induction.",

      "answer": "Tolerance is a pharmacological phenomenon in which repeated drug exposure produces a diminished response, requiring increasingly higher doses to achieve the same effect. It arises through two main mechanisms: pharmacokinetic tolerance (accelerated drug metabolism, often via enzyme induction) and pharmacodynamic tolerance (receptor downregulation or desensitization). Tolerance can develop independently of dependence. Dependence (physical dependence) is a state of neuroadaptation in which the body requires the drug to maintain normal functioning; abrupt discontinuation produces a characteristic withdrawal syndrome. For example, a patient on long-term benzodiazepines may become physically dependent and require a slow taper to avoid seizures on withdrawal. Dependence does not necessarily imply tolerance or addictive behavior.",

      "question": "What is the difference between physical dependence and psychological dependence on a psychoactive drug?",
      "answer": "Physical dependence is a neuroadaptive state in which the drug is required for normal physiological function; stopping the drug triggers measurable, often dangerous withdrawal symptoms. Examples include opioid withdrawal (muscle aches, sweating, vomiting), alcohol withdrawal (tremor, seizures, delirium tremens), and benzodiazepine withdrawal (anxiety, seizures). Medical supervision and gradual tapering are typically required. Psychological dependence refers to intense craving, compulsive drug-seeking, and continued use despite negative consequences, driven by the drug's reinforcing effects on the brain's reward system (mesolimbic dopamine pathway). It does not necessarily produce prominent physical withdrawal symptoms. Cocaine and amphetamines are prototypical examples: cessation causes profound craving and dysphoria but not severe physical withdrawal signs. Cannabis also produces primarily psychological dependence. In practice the two forms often co-occur.",

They are thought to reflect dopamine hyperactivity in mesolimbic pathways.

The Galatea effect is an intrapersonal (self-expectancy) effect: individuals who hold high expectations of themselves tend to perform better, functioning as a self-fulfilling prophecy driven by one's own beliefs.

This is the period of greatest vulnerability to teratogens: major structural malformations are most likely to result from teratogen exposure during the embryonic stage. The fetal stage begins at the 9th week and continues until birth. During this stage, already-formed structures grow, mature, and become functional.

Examples include alcohol (fetal alcohol syndrome), thalidomide, rubella, and high-dose radiation. Teratogenic effects depend on timing, dose, and the genetic vulnerability of the embryo or fetus. A mutagen is an agent that permanently alters DNA structure or sequence, potentially producing heritable genetic mutations. Mutagens can act across the lifespan, not just prenatally.

Reaction range refers to the breadth of phenotypic outcomes that a given genotype can produce across the range of possible environments. A wide reaction range means the environment substantially shapes the expressed trait; a narrow reaction range means the trait remains similar across environments.

A heritability of 0.70 for IQ means 70% of IQ score variability in that studied population can be attributed to genetic variation — not that 70% of any individual's IQ is genetically determined. Heritability estimates are population-specific, environment-specific, and change as environmental conditions change. Genetic determinism is the philosophical position that traits are fixed and inevitable based on one's genotype, regardless of environmental input. Behavioral genetics consistently refutes genetic determinism: even traits with high heritability show substantial environmental influence, and heritability evidence shows genes contribute probabilistically rather than deterministically.",

If the necessary input is absent during the critical period, normal development cannot occur and the resulting deficit is typically permanent and irreversible. The classic example is the visual system: covering one eye of a kitten during the first months of life causes permanent cortical reorganization and loss of normal binocular vision that cannot be restored later. A sensitive period is a more flexible optimal window during which experiences have their greatest formative influence, but development can still proceed — with considerably more effort — outside this window. Language acquisition has a sensitive period: individuals can learn language after childhood, but acquisition is slower and less complete. Sensitive periods are more common than true critical periods.",

Because psychotherapy can inflate the perceived value of client-provided services and complicate the therapeutic relationship, bartering is discouraged but explicitly conditionally allowed. Accepting gifts from clients is not directly addressed by a single APA standard but implicates multiple relationship concerns (Standard 3.05) and professional boundary considerations. Small, culturally normative gifts may be clinically appropriate; larger gifts or patterns of gift-giving can blur professional boundaries, create obligation, or reflect therapeutic material that warrants clinical attention.

      "answer": "A fear appeal is a persuasive message designed to arouse fear by highlighting the negative consequences of not complying with the recommended action (e.g., anti-smoking campaigns showing diseased lungs). According to protection motivation theory, fear appeals are most effective when the perceived threat is high AND the recommended action is seen as effective and feasible. A rational appeal persuades through logical arguments, facts, statistics, and evidence, relying on the audience's capacity for systematic evaluation. Rational appeals engage central route processing (ELM) and tend to produce stronger, more durable attitude change. Fear appeals primarily engage emotional processing; very high fear can produce defensive avoidance rather than attitude change, creating an inverted-U relationship between fear intensity and persuasive impact.",

The recency effect occurs when information presented LAST has the greatest persuasive influence. Miller and Campbell (1959) identified the conditions favoring each: the primacy effect is most likely when the two sides of an argument are presented back-to-back (no delay between them) but attitudes are assessed after a significant delay.

To reduce this unpleasant tension, the person changes an attitude, adds a new cognition, or trivializes the inconsistency. Attitude change is driven by the need to eliminate internal discomfort. Self-perception theory (Bem, 1972) proposes that people come to know their own attitudes by observing their own behavior, much as they would infer a stranger's attitude. No aversive arousal is required — people simply infer 'I must believe X since I acted as if X were true.' Both theories predict attitude change following counter-attitudinal behavior with insufficient justification, but dissonance requires prior inconsistency and felt arousal, while self-perception requires only ambiguity about one's prior attitude.",

The result is premature consensus and critically unevaluated decisions (e.g., Bay of Pigs invasion, Challenger disaster). The key dynamic is suppression of dissent to preserve group cohesion. Group polarization is the finding that group discussion shifts members' attitudes toward a more extreme version of their initial pre-discussion position — if members lean toward risk, they become riskier; if cautious, more cautious.

It operates prospectively as a person gathers and processes new information going forward. Hindsight bias (the 'I-knew-it-all-along' phenomenon) is the tendency, after learning the outcome of an event, to overestimate how predictable that outcome was before it occurred.

Familiarity alone is sufficient to generate positive affect. The similarity-attraction effect is the finding that people are more attracted to others who share similar attitudes, values, personality traits, and interests. Theoretical explanations include cognitive balance (similar others create balanced relational triads) and social validation (similar others confirm one's worldview and reinforce self-esteem).

Implicit attitudes are automatically activated evaluations that operate below conscious awareness and are not accessible to direct self-report. They are measured indirectly using response latency paradigms such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT).

It operates AFTER the situation has been recognized as an emergency: the problem is reduced felt obligation, not misreading the event. Pluralistic ignorance is the tendency to privately hold a belief or feeling while incorrectly assuming that others hold a different view. In a bystander context, an ambiguous emergency may not look like one because each bystander looks to the others, sees them remaining calm and inactive, and concludes the situation is not an emergency — even though every bystander privately feels uncertain. Pluralistic ignorance operates BEFORE emergency recognition: it prevents the situation from being defined as one requiring help in the first place.",

An optimal item difficulty for maximizing discrimination is approximately p = .50. Items with p > .90 (too easy) or p < .10 (too hard) contribute little to test differentiation. The item discrimination index (D) measures how well a given item distinguishes between high-scoring and low-scoring examinees — typically calculated by comparing the proportion correct in the high-scoring group vs. low-scoring group.

A test used for licensure has content validity if its items represent the full range of skills practitioners need. Face validity refers to whether a test APPEARS to measure what it's supposed to measure from the surface — i.e., whether items look relevant and appropriate to test-takers.

It occurs because regression capitalizes on chance relationships specific to the derivation sample that do not replicate. Shrinkage is addressed by cross-validation — applying the equation to a holdout sample and comparing the obtained R to the original. Restriction of range occurs when the variability of scores on the predictor or criterion is artificially limited in the validation sample — typically because selection has already occurred (e.g., only hired applicants are followed up). Range restriction attenuates (underestimates) the true validity coefficient in the full population, and statistical corrections exist to adjust for it.",

A grade equivalent score expresses performance as the grade and month of schooling for which the raw score is average (e.g., 5.4 = average performance in the fourth month of fifth grade).

      "answer": "Spearman's g (general factor) theory proposes that a single underlying general intelligence factor — g — explains the positive correlations observed among all cognitive ability tests. Spearman derived g using factor analysis and argued it represents a general mental capacity that pervades all intellectual performance. The model is hierarchical in the simplest sense: one factor at the apex. The Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model is a comprehensive three-stratum hierarchical model that integrates Spearman's g at Stratum III, Horn and Cattell's fluid-crystallized theory at Stratum II (including Gf, Gc, Gv, Gsm, Gs, and approximately eight other broad abilities), and Carroll's factor-analytic work identifying narrow cognitive abilities at Stratum I. CHC retains g but adds substantial structure below it. Most modern cognitive batteries — including the SB5, WAIS-IV, WJ-IV, and KABC-II — are explicitly grounded in CHC theory rather than the simpler g model.",

In vivo desensitization involves direct, real-world exposure to the actual feared stimulus or situation (e.g., a client with a dog phobia progressively approaches and eventually handles a real dog while remaining relaxed). This produces stronger extinction and generalization because the conditioned stimulus is encountered in its natural form. Imaginal desensitization involves vividly imagining the feared stimulus rather than confronting it in reality (e.g., the client pictures a dog at varying distances while relaxed). It is used when in vivo exposure is impractical, unsafe, or too distressing at the outset — for example, exposure to feared situations involving flying, surgery, or natural disasters. In vivo desensitization is generally considered more effective because it provides direct contact with the real CS; imaginal desensitization is preferred when real exposure is not yet feasible.",

Substance intoxication is an acute, time-limited, reversible syndrome resulting from recent ingestion of a substance, producing clinically significant maladaptive behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., impaired judgment, altered perception, mood changes).

CRAFT also helps CSOs improve their own quality of life independent of the IP. It has the strongest evidence base for engaging treatment-refusing individuals (~64-74% engagement rates). Al-Anon is a 12-step mutual support program for family members emphasizing acceptance, detachment with love, and the three Cs (did not Cause it, cannot Control it, cannot Cure it).

Nonparametric (distribution-free) tests do not assume a specific population distribution and are appropriate when data are nominal or ordinal, sample sizes are very small, or parametric assumptions are clearly violated.

A two-tailed (nondirectional) test splits the rejection region equally between both tails, testing whether there is any significant difference in either direction.
