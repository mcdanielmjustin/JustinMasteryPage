          "explanation": "Many collectivist and non-Western cultures express psychological distress primarily through somatic channels — this is not a defense mechanism or sign of limited insight, but a culturally congruent idiom of distress. The DSM-5-TR Cultural Formulation Interview acknowledges that individuals from many backgrounds first experience and communicate distress through physical symptoms (headaches, fatigue, chest tightness) rather than emotional language. Labeling this as 'somatization' (a Western psychoanalytic construct implying defense) imposes an etic framework that may be clinically inaccurate and therapeutically harmful. The appropriate approach is to meet the patient within her explanatory model.",

            "A": "Framing somatic presentation as a defense mechanism pathologizes a culturally normative expression of distress. This interpretation imposes a Western psychodynamic framework without cultural foundation.",
            "C": "While medical workup is reasonable to rule out primary medical causes, dismissing psychological factors given the clear psychosocial context (acculturation, loss, depression symptoms) would be clinically shortsighted.",
            "D": "Describing the patient as lacking psychological-mindedness is an ethnocentric judgment. She is expressing distress in a culturally coherent way; psychoeducation that invalidates her explanatory model would likely damage the therapeutic alliance."

          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Culturally responsive practice begins with the patient's explanatory model — her understanding of the problem, its causes, and its appropriate remedies. The DSM-5-TR Cultural Formulation Interview explicitly recommends exploring what the patient calls her condition, what she thinks caused it, and what kind of help she expects. 'Tampo' provides a culturally grounded entry point for the therapeutic alliance. The clinician can then gently build a shared formulation that respects her framework while introducing additional perspectives. Immediately replacing her explanatory model with DSM language would be invalidating and likely drive disengagement.",

This student is using separation — he actively maintains Korean cultural practices and values (daily contact with mother in Korean, strong Korean peer network, deference norms) while limiting integration into U.S. academic and social culture. Separation can preserve identity and cultural continuity, but in contexts that demand integration (a U.S. graduate program), it creates acculturative stress and social isolation.

The therapeutic approach should validate the legitimacy of both cultural value systems without privileging one as superior, then collaboratively develop behavioral strategies for specific high-demand contexts (graduate seminars) without requiring the student to abandon his core values.
