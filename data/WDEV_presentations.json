          "explanation": "The Integrated Developmental Model (IDM; Stoltenberg, McNeill, & Delworth) asserts that supervisee development is not uniform across all competencies — an intern may be Stage 3 in some domains and Stage 1 in others. Encountering a boundary violation situation with a personality disorder client is likely a Stage 1 experience for this intern: high anxiety, self-focus, motivation, and limited autonomous confidence. At Stage 1, the supervisor provides high structure (guidance, frameworks, modeling) combined with high support (validation, normalization). As competence in this area grows, structure decreases and autonomy increases.",

            "A": "While this intern demonstrates some Stage 1 features on this specific issue, IDM emphasizes competency-specific assessment, not a global Stage 1 label. Scripted responses without rationale also limit learning.",

          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "With BPD clients, limit-setting is most effective when it is therapeutically integrated — not delivered as a rule violation. The intern should proactively bring up the Instagram contact, validate the client's underlying wish for connection ('I noticed you reached out — I want to understand what that was about for you'), set the limit clearly without shaming ('I keep our relationship in the therapy space'), and use the interaction as material for therapy ('This might connect to things you've talked about — feeling close to people and worried about rejection'). This approach maintains alliance, addresses the boundary, and turns a potential rupture into therapeutic work.",
          "distractor_rationale": {
            "A": "Avoiding the incident allows it to fester and communicates that the topic is too dangerous to discuss — reinforcing the client's rejection fears and abandoning a valuable therapeutic opportunity.",
            "C": "A formal warning framing would be experienced as punitive by a BPD client, likely triggering abandonment fears and destabilizing the therapeutic relationship without therapeutic benefit.",
            "D": "Accepting the follow request would constitute a boundary violation — it blurs professional and personal roles, creates dual relationship concerns, and would significantly complicate treatment."

The belief that he is 'indispensable' is a cognitive distortion that maintains the unsafe caseload and reflects a common burnout feature (over-responsibility).
