The healthy resolution involves active exploration of values, beliefs, and roles (what Marcia called 'moratorium') followed by commitment to a coherent identity. This patient is in moratorium — actively exploring, not yet committed. The absence of clinical depression, the context of normative adolescent development, and the identity-focused content all point to this stage.

The developmentally appropriate counseling response is to support the exploration process rather than push toward premature commitment. This includes exploring his values, interests, and strengths; normalizing the process; and helping him communicate his needs to his parents — not resolving the conflict for him. Premature closure (foreclosure) forecloses exploration and often leads to identity crises later.",

MCI does NOT meet criteria for Major Neurocognitive Disorder (dementia), which requires significant functional impairment.

Depression screening is essential given recent bereavement — depression exacerbates cognitive complaints and is treatable. Annual neuropsychological monitoring tracks progression and guides future recommendations. Cholinesterase inhibitors (FDA approved for dementia, not MCI) have not shown benefit in MCI.
