The leader shares ideas and facilitates the follower's own decision making rather than directing or delegating entirely. This is commonly confused with S2 (Selling/Coaching), which also has high relationship orientation but additionally involves high task orientation where the leader explains decisions rather than facilitating follower-driven decisions."

This is distinct from 'Skills,' which refer to proficiency in performing specific tasks (learned and task-specific), and 'Knowledge,' which refers to a body of factual or procedural information. Abilities are relatively stable traits (e.g., verbal reasoning, empathy) rather than acquired proficiencies."
