The error substituted 'disposal' for 'protection,' which changes the meaning significantly. While disposal of records is addressed elsewhere in the standard, the specific provision about planning for withdrawal from practice, incapacity, or death focuses on ensuring records are transferred and protected, not destroyed."

      "modified_passage": "Clinical supervision is a core competency in professional psychology and carries significant ethical and legal responsibilities. According to the APA's supervision guidelines, supervisors hold vicarious liability for their supervisees' actions, meaning the supervisor can be held legally responsible for harm caused by the supervisee's professional conduct. Bernard's Discrimination Model identifies three primary supervisor roles—teacher, counselor, and consultant—and three areas of focus: intervention skills, conceptualization skills, and self-awareness. Importantly, the ethical principle of informed consent requires that clients be notified that their therapist is working under supervision. Supervisors are expected to provide formative and summative feedback, and the supervisory relationship is considered a fiduciary one. The APA Ethics Code addresses supervision primarily in Standard 7.06, which stipulates that supervisors must take reasonable steps to ensure competent practice by supervisees and must not engage in exploitative relationships with them.",
      "error_original": "Standard 7.06",
      "error_correct": "Standard 7.06 deals with assessing student and supervisee performance; the supervision responsibilities described (ensuring competent practice and avoiding exploitation) are primarily addressed in multiple standards, but the key standard specifically about supervisor responsibility for supervisees' work is Standard 2.05",

      ],
      "correct_option_index": 2,
      "explanation": "The passage attributes supervisory responsibilities (taking reasonable steps to ensure competent practice by supervisees) to APA Ethics Code Standard 7.06. However, Standard 7.06 pertains to assessing student and supervisee performance. The responsibility for ensuring that supervisees provide competent services falls primarily under Standard 2.05 (Delegation of Work to Others), which states that psychologists who delegate work to others take reasonable steps to ensure that such persons perform services competently. Bernard's Discrimination Model does include the three roles (teacher, counselor, consultant) and three focus areas (intervention, conceptualization, personalization/self-awareness) as stated. Supervisors do hold vicarious liability, not direct liability, so that statement is correct."

      "explanation": "The passage was modified to state that right unilateral ECT maintains efficacy at '3x seizure threshold,' but the correct stimulus intensity for adequate efficacy with right unilateral placement is typically 6x seizure threshold. This is a clinically important distinction because administering right unilateral ECT at too low a stimulus intensity relative to the seizure threshold results in significantly reduced efficacy compared to bilateral placement. The 6x threshold ensures that unilateral ECT achieves comparable antidepressant effects while preserving its cognitive advantage."

Cholinesterase inhibitors increase acetylcholine levels (increased cholinergic activity), which stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system and slows heart rate, resulting in bradycardia — not tachycardia. Tachycardia (increased heart rate) would be associated with sympathetic activation or anticholinergic effects, which is the opposite of what cholinesterase inhibitors produce."

      "explanation": "The passage was modified to say 'fine tremor' instead of the correct term 'coarse tremor.' Lithium toxicity is characterized by coarse tremor (as opposed to the fine tremor that can be a common, non-toxic side effect of lithium at therapeutic levels). The distinction between fine tremor (a benign side effect) and coarse tremor (a sign of toxicity) is a clinically important differentiation tested on the EPPP. The other options describe changes that were not actually made: NSAIDs do indeed alter lithium levels, lithium toxicity can indeed progress to seizures, and sodium restriction is correctly listed as a factor that alters lithium levels."

SSRIs such as fluoxetine and sertraline target serotonin and are used primarily for depression and anxiety disorders."

In reality, the HIPAA minimum necessary standard also does not apply to uses or disclosures made pursuant to an authorization, to disclosures required by law, or to disclosures to HHS for compliance investigations. However, the more testable and critical error here is actually a different one: the minimum necessary standard DOES apply to disclosures for treatment purposes according to the regulation's general rule — but HHS has chosen not to enforce it for treatment. More precisely, 45 CFR 164.502(b)(2) explicitly exempts disclosures 'to or requested by a health care provider for treatment,' disclosures to the individual, uses/disclosures pursuant to authorization, disclosures to HHS, uses/disclosures required by law, and uses/disclosures required for HIPAA compliance. The statement as written omits several key exceptions, but the core factual error is the claim that treatment is exempt — which is actually correct but incomplete. The testable point is recognizing the full scope of exceptions to the minimum necessary standard."

      "error_correct": "Standard 5.05 addresses testimonials, but the prohibition on soliciting testimonials from current clients falls under Standard 5.05 correctly; however, the error is that the standard number cited is 5.05 when the actual APA standard addressing testimonials is 5.05 — the real error is that it says 'prohibited from soliciting' when the standard states psychologists 'do not solicit' testimonials",
      "explanation": "The APA Ethics Code Standard 5.05 on Testimonials states that psychologists do not solicit testimonials from current therapy clients or other persons who are vulnerable to undue influence. The error in the definition is the standard number: testimonials are actually covered under APA Standard 5.05, but the definition incorrectly attributes full prohibition language. More precisely, the actual subtle error is the standard number — APA's prohibition on soliciting testimonials from vulnerable persons is Standard 5.05, which is correctly cited. Let me correct this."

          "definition": "Cross-tolerance refers to the phenomenon where tolerance to one substance extends to other pharmacologically similar substances. Benzodiazepines, alcohol, and barbiturates all exhibit cross-tolerance because they all act on NMDA receptors. This has important clinical implications for managing withdrawal and determining effective dosages.",

This principle underlies the clinical use of long-acting benzodiazepines to manage alcohol withdrawal. It reflects shared neurochemical mechanisms between substances acting on similar receptor systems.",

This involves changes at the receptor level such as downregulation or desensitization of receptor sites. It is distinguished from pharmacokinetic tolerance, which involves changes in drug metabolism.",

Combining benzodiazepines with alcohol or barbiturates can produce dangerous synergistic CNS depression.

      "explanation": "The error is in the receptor type. Benzodiazepines, alcohol, and barbiturates all exhibit cross-tolerance because they all act on GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors, not NMDA receptors. NMDA receptors are glutamate receptors involved in excitatory neurotransmission, whereas GABA receptors mediate inhibitory neurotransmission and are the shared mechanism underlying cross-tolerance among these sedative-hypnotic substances."

      "explanation": "The passage states that psychologists should consider maintaining separate personal and professional social media accounts. The error reverses this guidance, claiming psychologists should merge their accounts. Maintaining separate accounts is recommended to preserve professional boundaries and protect both the psychologist's personal privacy and the therapeutic relationship."
