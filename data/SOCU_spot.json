Hindsight bias involves people reconstructing their prior beliefs to be MORE consistent with the known outcome than those beliefs actually were — that is, people falsely remember having predicted the outcome all along. Saying 'less consistent' reverses the core mechanism of the bias."

      "explanation": "The passage incorrectly refers to 'inter-rater reliability,' which concerns agreement between different raters or observers. The actual criticism of the IAT centers on its moderate 'test-retest reliability,' which assesses consistency of scores across repeated administrations. This distinction is important because low or moderate test-retest reliability specifically raises the question of whether the IAT captures a stable trait (like implicit bias) or a momentary, fluctuating state. Inter-rater reliability is a different psychometric concept that does not directly address the trait-versus-state concern."

Attitudes are better predictors of behavior when social pressure is LOW, because high social pressure can override personal attitudes and lead people to behave in ways inconsistent with their true beliefs (e.g., conformity effects). The original correct statement specifies that low social pressure allows attitudes to more freely guide behavior."

      "explanation": "The passage incorrectly attributes the anchoring effect on judges' sentencing decisions to the defense attorney's recommended sentence.

The defense attorney's recommendation would typically argue for a lighter sentence and is not the anchor described in the original research finding."

The modified passage subtly changed this to 'tolerance,' which is a weaker and qualitatively different concept. In Phinney's model, the achieved ethnic identity stage is characterized by a secure identity that goes beyond mere tolerance to genuine appreciation of other groups. This distinction is important because 'tolerance' implies passively putting up with differences, whereas 'appreciation' reflects an active, positive regard for diversity — a hallmark of the highest stage of ethnic identity development."

Seeking 'confirming evidence' would instead represent confirmation bias — the very cognitive bias that base rate neglect and other heuristic errors exploit. Effective clinical decision-making requires clinicians to challenge their hypotheses by looking for evidence that would rule them out, not confirm them."

      "explanation": "The actor-observer bias states that actors attribute their OWN behavior to situational (external) factors and OTHERS' behavior to dispositional (internal) factors. The error reverses this pattern — stating actors attribute their own behavior to dispositional factors and others' to situational factors, which is the opposite of the correct definition. This is a core distinction tested on the EPPP, and the reversal here is non-obvious because it requires knowing the specific direction of the bias rather than simply guessing from general logic."

In Moscovici's actual blue-green slide experiment, the consistent minority influenced only about 8% of responses (with about 32% of participants conforming at least once), not 75%. The 75% figure belongs to Asch's conformity paradigm, where participants conformed to a unanimous majority."

According to Altman and Taylor, early interactions are characterized by broad but shallow disclosures (many topics, low intimacy). As trust develops, disclosures become deeper and more personal — not the other way around. The erroneous definition states that early interactions are 'narrow but deep' and become 'more superficial,' which is the opposite of the theory's actual claims."
