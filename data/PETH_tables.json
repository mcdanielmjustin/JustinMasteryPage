      "explanation": "Alpha-2 receptors are presynaptic autoreceptors that inhibit norepinephrine release. Mirtazapine's mechanism of action involves blocking these alpha-2 autoreceptors, which disinhibits NE release (increasing it), while clonidine is an alpha-2 agonist that activates these receptors to reduce NE release—making it useful for conditions involving noradrenergic hyperactivity such as ADHD, opioid withdrawal, and hypertension. This is highly testable because it requires understanding both agonist and antagonist actions at the same receptor subtype."

      "explanation": "Scope of Practice (Legal) sets the outer boundary of permitted practice, meaning it defines the maximum range of activities a licensed professional is legally allowed to perform. This contrasts with competence (ethical), which can be narrower than scope of practice because an individual may not have training in all areas their license legally permits. This distinction is critical for understanding that being legally permitted to perform an activity does not automatically mean one is ethically competent to do so."

This is a highly testable concept because it links receptor pharmacology to the clinical observation of delayed SSRI efficacy."
