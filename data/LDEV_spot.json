Stage 5 involves reasoning based on social contracts and individual rights, while Stage 6 involves reasoning based on universal ethical principles and abstract notions of justice. The passage was modified to say Stage 5 instead of the correct Stage 6."

      "explanation": "The original passage correctly states that after the critical period, language acquisition becomes 'qualitatively different and more effortful.' The modified passage changed 'qualitatively' to 'quantitatively,' which is a subtle but important distinction. Lenneberg's critical period hypothesis specifically argues that post-critical-period language acquisition is qualitatively different — meaning it differs in kind and nature (e.g., relying on different cognitive mechanisms), not merely in amount or degree (which 'quantitatively' would imply)."

Abstract thought, by contrast, is a hallmark of Piaget's formal operational stage (approximately age 11 and older). Substituting 'abstract thought' for 'symbolic thought' is a subtle but significant factual error that changes the defining characteristic of the stage."

The modified passage substitutes 'theoretical' for 'hypothetical.' In Piaget's theory, the key distinction between the Concrete Operational Stage and the subsequent Formal Operational Stage is the ability to engage in abstract and hypothetical reasoning -- the capacity to think about possibilities, test hypotheses, and reason about what could be rather than just what is. 'Theoretical' is a subtle but incorrect substitution for the precise Piagetian term 'hypothetical.'"

(2007)."

The passage subtly substituted 'autonomy' for 'stability,' changing the key developmental goal of this period. While autonomy is a plausible-sounding developmental concept, the correct characterization of this era emphasizes the tension between exploration and the desire for stability."

Separation protest is a hallmark of the next phase, clear-cut attachment.

'Transductive reasoning' is a different preoperational characteristic in which children reason from particular to particular (e.g., assuming that because two events occur together, one caused the other). The error requires distinguishing between distinct Piagetian preoperational concepts."

Seriation (the ability to order objects along a dimension) is also a concrete operational skill but is not the one Kohlberg linked to gender constancy. Conservation is the relevant cognitive prerequisite because gender constancy requires understanding that gender does not change despite changes in outward appearance."
