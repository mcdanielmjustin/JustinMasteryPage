            "A": "The FSIQ of 100 is valid because it is the most reliable composite score and should guide all diagnostic and placement decisions",

WISC-V interpretation guidelines recommend reporting and interpreting index scores as the primary level of analysis when variability is high, because each index measures a distinct cognitive ability. In Emma's case, the VCI (114) and VSI (118) reflect genuine high-average ability, while the PSI (82) reflects a specific processing deficit — FSIQ of 100 obscures this important diagnostic information.",

This is a classic 2e presentation.

The neuropsychologist then interprets SVT performance in context: below-chance performance suggests non-credible effort; results within normal limits provide evidentiary support for the credibility of other cognitive findings.
