Cerebellar lesions may cause initial gait ataxia and balance problems. Large strokes can cause fatal herniation due to posterior fossa mass effect."

      "question": "A patient with a thalamic lacunar infarct has dense contralateral hemibody pain and temperature loss, loss of proprioception, and reduced vibration sense — affecting face, arm, and leg equally. Motor strength is fully preserved. Which cortical relay station was damaged in the subcortical pathway to the cortex?",

      "distractor_regions": ["parietal_lobe", "motor_cortex", "frontal_lobe"],
      "explanation": "Thalamic lesions disconnect subcortical sensory relay (VPL/VPM nuclei) from the somatosensory cortex. The resulting pure sensory stroke (no weakness, no aphasia) affects all sensory modalities (touch, pain, temperature, proprioception) on the contralateral face + body equally. The somatosensory cortex is the cortical target — its disconnection from thalamic input mimics cortical somatosensory loss."

      "question": "A patient has difficulty inhibiting inappropriate responses. She says obscene words out loud in social settings (coprolalia) and blurts out actions before thinking.

      "explanation": "Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and anterior cingulate cortex regulate impulse control, social behavior inhibition, and sustained attention. OFC damage (or functional dysregulation in Tourette's and ADHD) impairs the ability to suppress prepotent or contextually inappropriate responses. This region is critical for real-world behavioral regulation."

      "question": "A 72-year-old patient develops sudden onset of global amnesia lasting 6 hours — she repeatedly asks the same questions, cannot remember recent events, but is oriented and her neurological exam is normal. MRI DWI shows a tiny bright spot in the medial temporal lobe. Which vascular territory was transiently compromised?",
      "target_region": "temporal_lobe",
      "distractor_regions": ["frontal_lobe", "parietal_lobe", "occipital_lobe"],
      "explanation": "Transient global amnesia (TGA) involves transient ischemia to the medial temporal lobe (hippocampus), typically in the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory. The event is sudden-onset anterograde amnesia with repetitive questioning, lasting minutes to hours, with complete recovery. The medial temporal lobe (hippocampus) is the critical structure for this amnestic episode."

      "distractor_regions": ["frontal_lobe", "parietal_lobe", "brocas_area"],
      "explanation": "Anomic aphasia (pure anomia) specifically implicates the left angular gyrus or posterior temporal cortex — regions that mediate lexical retrieval (word-finding). Preserved fluency rules out Broca's area damage; preserved comprehension rules out Wernicke's area. Anomia is the mildest aphasia and can result from almost any left hemisphere lesion but is most pure with posterior temporal damage."

      "explanation": "The primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus) is the final cortical output for voluntary movement. Its somatotopic organization (homunculus) means focal lesions produce focal contralateral weakness. Face and arm are represented laterally (MCA territory); leg is medial (ACA territory). Upper motor neuron signs (spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski) distinguish this from lower motor neuron lesions."

      "distractor_regions": ["cerebellum", "motor_cortex", "prefrontal_cortex"],
      "explanation": "Episodic memory (personal autobiographical events) depends critically on the hippocampus in the medial temporal lobe. Intact procedural learning (piano motor sequences) relies on the cerebellum and basal ganglia — preserved with hippocampal damage. The double dissociation between episodic and procedural memory confirms medial temporal lobe as the critical structure for declarative/episodic encoding."
