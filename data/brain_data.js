Visual text is processed by the right hemisphere but cannot cross the splenium to reach the left's reading circuits. Writing is preserved because it relies on left hemisphere motor memory, not visual input. The key differentiator from Wernicke's aphasia is preserved writing and comprehension.

The pain is of CENTRAL origin (thalamus generating pathological signals), not peripheral tissue damage — hence opioid resistance.

      "explanation": "Klüver-Bucy syndrome results from bilateral amygdala and anterior temporal lobe damage. The amygdala is the critical structure for the core behavioral features: placidity (loss of fear and aggression — amygdala mediates threat appraisal), hyperorality (amygdala regulates oral exploratory behavior), and hypersexuality (disinhibited reward-seeking). Visual agnosia reflects adjacent temporal association cortex damage; hypermetamorphosis reflects loss of stimulus filtering. Herpes simplex virus preferentially infects temporal lobes via the olfactory-limbic route, causing bilateral amygdala and temporal destruction. The syndrome is also seen after bilateral temporal lobectomy, advanced Alzheimer's disease, and frontotemporal dementia. Klüver-Bucy is among the highest-yield amygdala syndromes for the EPPP."

      "question": "A patient with Urbach-Wiethe disease (bilateral amygdala calcification from lipoid proteinosis) undergoes classical fear conditioning: a neutral tone (CS) is paired with mild electric shock (US). Normal subjects develop conditioned fear (skin conductance response and self-reported fear to tone alone). This patient shows no skin conductance response and reports no fear to the tone after extensive conditioning — yet she explicitly remembers every detail of the conditioning session and correctly describes what was paired with what. Which structure's loss best explains the absent conditioned fear despite intact declarative memory?",
      "target_region": "amygdala",
      "distractor_regions": ["hippocampus", "cingulate_gyrus", "thalamus"],
      "explanation": "The amygdala (basolateral complex) is essential for acquiring and expressing classically conditioned fear. LeDoux's 'low road': auditory CS → auditory thalamus → lateral amygdala triggers fast, automatic conditioned fear (SCR, behavioral). The hippocampus encodes the DECLARATIVE memory of the session (what happened, where, when) — which is intact here. The classic double dissociation: amygdala damage = no conditioned fear but normal declarative memory of the event; hippocampal damage = conditioned fear remains but no declarative memory of training. This dissociation demonstrates that emotional conditioning (amygdala) and explicit memory (hippocampus) are parallel, independent memory systems — a cornerstone of EPPP affective neuroscience and the neurobiology of anxiety disorders."

      "explanation": "The amygdala is the brain's emotional appraisal center. Bilateral damage impairs: fear conditioning (cannot acquire CS-US fear associations), recognition of fearful facial expressions, and assignment of emotional significance to stimuli — producing placidity. Declarative memory for events is preserved because the hippocampus is intact. Option 2 (non-fluent speech + weakness) is Broca's area/motor cortex damage. Option 3 (anterograde amnesia) is hippocampal damage. Option 4 (sensory loss) is somatosensory cortex or thalamic damage. Clinically, amygdala hyperreactivity is implicated in PTSD and anxiety disorders — the converse of the placidity seen with bilateral destruction — making it the amygdala's most testable clinical relevance for the EPPP."

Between episodes, coworkers note that he sometimes cannot recall events from the previous several days. MRI reveals a smooth round cystic lesion at the foramen of Monro in the roof of the third ventricle.

      "explanation": "Colloid cysts arise at the foramen of Monro (roof of third ventricle) and compress the fornix columns as they arch through this region en route to the mamillary bodies. Fornix compression disrupts hippocampal output — the postcommissural fornix carries hippocampal projections to mamillary bodies, breaking the Papez circuit relay essential for episodic memory. Position-dependent headaches and syncope reflect intermittent CSF obstruction (colloid cyst acting as a ball valve at the foramen of Monro). Colloid cysts are benign but potentially lethal — sudden CSF obstruction causes acute hydrocephalus and sudden death. The specific anatomy — fornix compressed by third-ventricle colloid cyst at the foramen of Monro — is a classic EPPP structural neuroanatomy question."

Bilateral fornix damage disconnects the hippocampus from the Papez circuit (hippocampus → fornix → mamillary bodies → anterior thalamus → cingulate → hippocampus), producing anterograde amnesia qualitatively similar to bilateral hippocampal lesions. The fornix is damaged in Korsakoff syndrome, surgical transection, and colloid cyst compression at the foramen of Monro. Options 2–4 describe conduction aphasia (arcuate fasciculus), motor cortex damage, and occipital cortex damage respectively — entirely different structures and presentations."

The motor and sensory homunculus maps the LEG on the medial cortical surface (ACA territory), while the arm and face are represented laterally (MCA territory). ACA occlusion therefore produces contralateral LEG > arm weakness and sensory loss — the opposite of the arm-face predominant pattern of MCA stroke. Urinary incontinence reflects damage to the paracentral lobule's bladder inhibitory center. This leg-predominant UMN syndrome with incontinence on medial cortex MRI is pathognomonic for ACA territory stroke and tests the clinically critical homunculus geography: leg = medial (ACA), arm/face = lateral (MCA)."

After SMA resection, the classic SMA syndrome develops: transient contralateral hemiplegia and mutism that resolve as ipsilateral SMA compensates. The hallmark is selective inability to self-initiate movements on command, while externally-triggered responses (catching a thrown object) are preserved. This internally-generated vs. externally-triggered dissociation is pathognomonic for SMA damage and distinguishes it from primary motor cortex lesions (persistent deficits, no task specificity) and frontal executive lesions (planning deficits without this motor initiation pattern)."

The UPPER BANK (cuneus) receives superior optic radiations (traveling through the parietal lobe) and represents the INFERIOR visual field. Therefore, temporal lobe damage compressing Meyer's loop causes loss of superior visual field ('pie in the sky').

Knowing which calcarine bank processes which quadrant — lingual = superior field, cuneus = inferior field — is high-yield for EPPP visual pathway localization questions."
