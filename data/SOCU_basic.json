This reflects the internalization of oppressive values that privilege lighter skin, which historically was associated with proximity to whiteness and thus higher status in racist systems. Explicit prejudice and institutional discrimination describe external forms of bias rather than internal acceptance of racist standards, and outgroup homogeneity bias refers to perceptions of similarity within outgroups.","legacy_domain_code":"CLI","legacy_domain_name":"Clinical Psychology"},{"id":"JQ-CLI-209-clinical_scenario","source_question_id":"209","source_exam":"Exam 1","source_question_number":14,"source_summary":"The adoption of \"colorism\" - or the association of a light skin tone with higher status and greater beauty - by some African Americans is an example of internalized racism.","domain_code":"SOCU","domain_name":"Social & Cultural Psychology","subdomain":"Cross-Cultural Issues - Terms and Concepts","angle":"clinical_scenario","question":"An African American female client presents to therapy expressing low self-esteem and dissatisfaction with her appearance. During the assessment, she reveals that she has been using skin-lightening products for years and explicitly states that she believes lighter skin is more beautiful and would increase her chances of professional and romantic success. When asked about the origin of these beliefs, she attributes them to personal preference rather than external pressure. How would a culturally informed clinician most accurately conceptualize this client's self-perception?","options":{"A":"A rational assessment of societal beauty standards that she has autonomously chosen to adopt","B":"An example of internalized racism reflecting the absorption of dominant-culture racial hierarchies","C":"Evidence of clinical depression manifesting as negative body image","D":"A culturally normative preference that requires no therapeutic intervention"},"correct_answer":"B","explanation":"A culturally informed clinician would recognize that the client's belief system reflects internalized racism—the internalization of white supremacist beauty standards and racial hierarchies that devalue darker skin tones. Her attribution to 'personal preference' is itself a symptom of internalization, as she has absorbed these standards so completely that they feel intrinsic rather than imposed. This understanding is essential for effective cross-cultural treatment, as it locates the origin of her distress in systemic racism rather than personal pathology alone. While depression may be comorbid, the core issue is internalized oppression.","legacy_domain_code":"CLI","legacy_domain_name":"Clinical Psychology"},{"id":"JQ-CLI-209-contrast","source_question_id":"209","source_exam":"Exam 1","source_question_number":14,"source_summary":"The adoption of \"colorism\" - or the association of a light skin tone with higher status and greater beauty - by some African Americans is an example of internalized racism.","domain_code":"SOCU","domain_name":"Social & Cultural Psychology","subdomain":"Cross-Cultural Issues - Terms and Concepts","angle":"contrast","question":"Which of the following best distinguishes internalized racism from institutional racism?","options":{"A":"Internalized racism is conscious while institutional racism is unconscious","B":"Internalized racism involves structural systems excluding marginalized groups, whereas institutional racism involves systemic policies and practices embedded in organizations","C":"Internalized racism occurs when members of marginalized groups accept and adopt oppressive beliefs about themselves, while institutional racism refers to systemic discrimination built into organizational structures and policies","D":"Internalized racism only affects individuals, while institutional racism affects entire communities"},"correct_answer":"C","explanation":"Internalized racism is a psychological process whereby individuals from marginalized groups absorb and accept negative beliefs and hierarchies from the dominant culture, applying them to themselves and their group. Institutional racism, by contrast, refers to systemic policies, practices, and structures within organizations that perpetuate discrimination and disadvantage. While they are related and often reinforce each other, they operate at different levels—one is intrapsychic and interpersonal, the other is structural and organizational.

The parent's beliefs about skin tone determining opportunity and attractiveness reflect absorption of systemic racism. Options A and B represent external institutional and historical discrimination.

What is a critical implication of this formulation for treatment planning?","options":{"A":"Treatment must address not only individual self-esteem but also the client's critical examination of the systemic racist origins of beauty standards they have internalized","B":"The clinician should primarily focus on building the client's self-esteem through cognitive-behavioral techniques without introducing discussions of race or racism","C":"The client's preference for lighter skin should be validated as a legitimate personal choice unrelated to systemic oppression","D":"Treatment should prioritize acceptance of current body image rather than exploring the social and historical context of beauty standards"},"correct_answer":"A","explanation":"Recognizing colorism as internalized racism has the critical implication that therapeutic work must be both intrapsychic and sociocultural. The clinician must help the client not only build self-worth but also develop critical consciousness about how racist systems have shaped their internalized beliefs about beauty and status. This involves psychoeducation about the history and mechanisms of colorism, examination of how dominant-culture narratives were absorbed, and support for deconstructing these oppressive standards.

In conformity, clients prefer White therapists because they have internalized dominant culture superiority.

Terror management theory specifically implicates mortality salience and the need to defend one's cultural worldview as the driver of intergroup attitudes.
