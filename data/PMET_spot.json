Unconditioned Response (UR): The unlearned, naturally occurring response to the unconditioned stimulus (e.g., salivation to food). Conditioned Stimulus (CS): A previously neutral stimulus that, after association with the US, comes to trigger a conditioned response (e.g., bell after pairing with food). Conditioned Response (CR): The learned response to the conditioned stimulus (e.g., salivation to the bell)",

      "explanation": "The Conditioned Stimulus (CS) is defined as a previously neutral stimulus — one that did not naturally produce the conditioned response before training. Calling it a 'reflexive stimulus' would imply it already triggered an automatic response, which instead describes an unconditioned stimulus (US). The defining feature of the CS is that it starts out neutral and only acquires response-eliciting power through repeated pairing with the US."

      ],
      "correct_option_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Effective exposure therapy requires practice across multiple, varied contexts. Because extinction is highly context-dependent, fear eliminated in the therapist's office may reemerge when the client encounters the feared stimulus in a different environment (e.g., a grocery store, public transit). Exposing the client in only a single context fails to promote generalization and is the opposite of best practice."

      "explanation": "The context-dependent drug tolerance model — explaining overdoses in unfamiliar settings — is the work of psychologist Shepard Siegel, not John B. Watson. Watson is primarily known for founding behaviorism and the Little Albert fear-conditioning experiment. Siegel demonstrated that drug tolerance is a conditioned compensatory response, and that novel environments lacking those conditioned cues can cause a lethal drug effect at the user's usual dose."

The visual appearance of dogs (CS) was present just before and during the bite. After this single pairing (one-trial learning), the child now experiences fear (CR) when seeing any dog. The temporal relationship - seeing the dog immediately before and during the painful bite - exemplifies delay conditioning producing rapid fear acquisition",

      "correct_option_index": 0,
      "explanation": "Fear conditioning following a single, highly aversive event is called one-trial learning (or single-trial learning). The passage explicitly states 'After this single pairing' — confirming only one CS–US pairing occurred. Multi-trial learning refers to the typical gradual acquisition over repeated pairings, which is the opposite of what is described here. Highly traumatic or aversive events are classically associated with one-trial fear conditioning."

After conditioning fear to a white rat (CS) by pairing it with a loud noise (US), Albert showed fear responses not only to the rat but also to a rabbit, a dog, a fur coat, and even a Santa Claus mask - stimuli that shared the white, furry characteristics of the original CS. This generalization occurred despite these stimuli never being directly paired with the aversive noise",

      ],
      "correct_option_index": 2,
      "explanation": "The Little Albert study demonstrated stimulus generalization — the spread of a conditioned fear response to stimuli that resemble the original CS (the white rat). Albert's fear extending to a rabbit, fur coat, and Santa Claus mask is a textbook example of generalization. Stimulus discrimination is the opposite process, where an organism learns to respond only to the specific CS and not to similar stimuli. The word 'generalization' even appears later in the passage, further confirming the error."
