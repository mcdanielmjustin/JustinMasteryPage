Conditioned Stimulus (CS): A previously neutral stimulus that, after association with the US, comes to trigger a conditioned response (e.g., bell after pairing with food). Conditioned Response (CR): The learned response to the conditioned stimulus (e.g., salivation to the bell)",

      "explanation": "The Conditioned Stimulus (CS) is defined as a previously neutral stimulus — one that did not naturally produce the conditioned response before training. Calling it a 'reflexive stimulus' would imply it already triggered an automatic response, which instead describes an unconditioned stimulus (US). The defining feature of the CS is that it starts out neutral and only acquires response-eliciting power through repeated pairing with the US."

Because extinction is highly context-dependent, fear eliminated in the therapist's office may reemerge when the client encounters the feared stimulus in a different environment (e.g., a grocery store, public transit). Exposing the client in only a single context fails to promote generalization and is the opposite of best practice."

      "explanation": "The Little Albert study demonstrated stimulus generalization — the spread of a conditioned fear response to stimuli that resemble the original CS (the white rat). Albert's fear extending to a rabbit, fur coat, and Santa Claus mask is a textbook example of generalization. Stimulus discrimination is the opposite process, where an organism learns to respond only to the specific CS and not to similar stimuli. The word 'generalization' even appears later in the passage, further confirming the error."

      "explanation": "Reinstatement is a phenomenon in which the conditioned response reappears (returns) after the organism is re-exposed to the unconditioned stimulus following extinction. It does not cause the response to 'weaken further' — that would be the opposite of what reinstatement demonstrates. Reinstatement is one of the key pieces of evidence that extinction is new learning rather than erasure, precisely because the original association can be recovered."
