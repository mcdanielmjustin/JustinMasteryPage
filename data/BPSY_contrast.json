      "question": "What is the difference between an agonist and an antagonist of a neurotransmitter?",
      "answer": "An agonist mimics or enhances the effects of a neurotransmitter by binding to and activating its receptor, thereby producing the same physiological response as the neurotransmitter. An antagonist binds to the receptor but blocks or inhibits the neurotransmitter's effects without activating it, reducing the neurotransmitter's action.",
      "key_distinction": "Agonist = activates; Antagonist = blocks.",

      "question": "What is the difference between GABA and glutamate as neurotransmitters?",
      "answer": "GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is the brain's primary inhibitory neurotransmitter; it reduces neural excitability and produces calming effects. Disruption of GABA activity is associated with anxiety disorders, and benzodiazepines work by potentiating GABA. Glutamate is the brain's primary excitatory neurotransmitter; it increases neural excitability and plays a central role in learning and memory via long-term potentiation (LTP). Excessive glutamate can be neurotoxic (excitotoxicity).",

      "question": "What is the difference between the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system?",
      "answer": "The sympathetic nervous system mediates the 'fight-or-flight' response: it increases heart rate, dilates pupils, inhibits digestion, and releases epinephrine/norepinephrine. The parasympathetic nervous system mediates the 'rest-and-digest' response: it decreases heart rate, constricts pupils, promotes digestion, and releases acetylcholine. The two systems are generally antagonistic and work together to maintain homeostasis.",
      "key_distinction": "Sympathetic = arousal/emergency; Parasympathetic = restoration/calm.",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Students often confuse which system uses acetylcholine — both do at different junctions, but the parasympathetic is primarily cholinergic.",

      "answer": "Broca's aphasia results from damage to Broca's area in the left frontal lobe. Speech is nonfluent, labored, and telegraphic, but comprehension is largely intact. The patient knows what they want to say but cannot produce it fluently. Wernicke's aphasia results from damage to Wernicke's area in the left temporal lobe. Speech is fluent but contains paraphasias, neologisms, and word substitutions ('word salad'); comprehension is severely impaired. The patient speaks easily but cannot understand language or recognize their own errors.",

      "question": "What is the difference between the emotional effects of left vs. right hemisphere cortical damage?",
      "answer": "Damage to the left hemisphere is more likely to produce depression or emotional volatility — often called the 'catastrophic reaction.' This may be due to disruption of left hemisphere involvement in positive affect and approach motivation. Damage to the right hemisphere is more likely to produce indifference, euphoria, or inappropriate affect — sometimes called 'la belle indifférence' — and is associated with anosognosia (denial/unawareness of deficits) and contralateral neglect (especially right parietal damage).",

      "question": "What is the difference between contralateral neglect and anosognosia?",
      "answer": "Contralateral neglect (hemispatial neglect) is a failure to attend to, perceive, or respond to stimuli on the side of space opposite the brain lesion — most commonly left-side neglect from right parietal damage. The patient shaves only the right side of their face or eats only the food on the right side of the plate. Anosognosia is a lack of awareness or denial of one's own disability or illness, also most commonly caused by right parietal lobe damage. A patient with anosognosia may deny they have hemiplegia when it is obvious to observers.",

      "question": "What is the difference between the roles of the hippocampus and the amygdala in memory?",
      "answer": "The hippocampus is essential for the formation of new long-term declarative memories (both episodic and semantic). Damage to the hippocampus results in anterograde amnesia (inability to form new explicit memories). The amygdala is central to the formation and consolidation of emotional memories, especially fear-related memories. It modulates memory storage in other areas based on emotional significance. Key distinction: the hippocampus processes what happened; the amygdala attaches emotional meaning and intensity to those memories.",

      "question": "What is the difference between the thalamus and the hypothalamus?",
      "answer": "The thalamus acts as the brain's primary sensory relay station, routing incoming sensory information (all senses except olfaction) to the appropriate areas of the cerebral cortex. It sits at the top of the brainstem. The hypothalamus regulates the four F's (feeding, fighting, fleeing, and sexual behavior), body temperature, circadian rhythms, and the endocrine system through control of the pituitary gland. It lies below the thalamus and has extensive connections to the endocrine and autonomic nervous systems.",

      "question": "What is the difference between the cerebellum and the basal ganglia in motor function?",
      "answer": "The cerebellum coordinates smooth, precise voluntary movement, balance, and motor learning. Damage to the cerebellum produces ataxia, slurred speech, and symptoms resembling intoxication — as seen after skateboarding accidents affecting the cerebellum. The basal ganglia are involved in the initiation, regulation, and modulation of voluntary movement, procedural learning, and habit formation. Damage is associated with movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (dopamine deficit) and Huntington's disease (GABA/glutamate abnormalities).",

      "question": "What is the difference between the James-Lange and Cannon-Bard theories of emotion?",
      "answer": "The James-Lange theory proposes that emotions follow physiological arousal: a stimulus triggers a bodily response (e.g., running), and the perception of that bodily state produces the subjective emotional experience (e.g., fear). The emotion is the interpretation of the body's reaction. The Cannon-Bard theory proposes that the physiological response and the subjective emotional experience occur simultaneously and independently, not in sequence. Cannon critiqued James-Lange by showing that the same bodily state can accompany different emotions.",

      "question": "What is the difference between the Cannon-Bard and Schachter-Singer theories of emotion?",
      "answer": "The Cannon-Bard theory holds that the body and the emotion are activated simultaneously and independently. The Schachter-Singer (two-factor) theory proposes that emotion requires two components: undifferentiated physiological arousal and a cognitive label. All emotions produce the same general arousal; the label we attach (based on situational context) determines which specific emotion we experience. This explains misattribution of arousal — if arousal from one source is attributed to another, the experienced emotion changes (e.g., bridge study).",
      "key_distinction": "Cannon-Bard = simultaneous, independent body and feeling; Schachter-Singer = arousal + cognitive label = emotion.",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Both involve physiological arousal and subjective emotion occurring together, but Schachter-Singer adds the critical cognitive labeling step.",

      "question": "What is the difference between primary appraisal and secondary appraisal in Lazarus's cognitive appraisal theory of stress?",
      "answer": "In Lazarus's theory, primary appraisal involves evaluating whether an event is irrelevant, benign/positive, or stressful (threatening, harmful, or challenging). It answers: 'Does this matter to me?' Secondary appraisal occurs after an event is perceived as stressful; it involves evaluating one's available coping resources and options. It answers: 'What can I do about it?' Together these determine the nature and intensity of the stress response.",

      "question": "What is the difference between REM and NREM sleep?",
      "answer": "REM (rapid eye movement) sleep is characterized by desynchronized, low-amplitude brain activity similar to wakefulness, rapid eye movements, skeletal muscle atonia, vivid dreaming, and memory consolidation for procedural and emotional memories. NREM sleep is divided into three stages (N1, N2, N3) and is characterized by high-amplitude, low-frequency (slow) brain waves. NREM is associated with physical restoration and declarative memory consolidation. Slow-wave sleep (N3, deep NREM) is dominant early in the night; REM periods lengthen as the night progresses. Sleepwalking and sleep terrors occur during NREM.",

      "question": "What is the difference between anterograde amnesia and retrograde amnesia?",
      "answer": "Anterograde amnesia is the inability to form new long-term memories after the onset of a brain injury or illness. The person cannot remember anything that happens after the injury, though their memories from before are often intact. It is typically caused by hippocampal damage. Retrograde amnesia is the loss of memories that were formed before the onset of injury or illness. When retrograde amnesia is present, recently acquired memories are typically lost before older, more consolidated memories (Ribot's law).",

Delayed sleep phase involves falling asleep and waking up significantly later than conventional times (e.g., sleeping from 3 AM to noon). It is most common in adolescents and young adults. Both are classified as circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders.",

      "answer": "Structural neuroimaging produces static images of the brain's anatomy and physical structure. CT scans use X-rays and are excellent for detecting acute hemorrhage rapidly. MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce high-resolution images of soft tissue structure. Functional neuroimaging captures brain activity and metabolism in real time. PET (positron emission tomography) measures glucose metabolism or blood flow using radioactive tracers. fMRI (functional MRI) measures the BOLD signal (blood oxygen level–dependent) reflecting neural activity.

      "answer": "SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) selectively block the reuptake of serotonin. They are better tolerated, have fewer anticholinergic and cardiac side effects, and are much safer in overdose than TCAs. Common side effects include sexual dysfunction, GI upset, and risk of serotonin syndrome. TCAs (tricyclic antidepressants) have a broader mechanism, blocking reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine as well as having significant anticholinergic, antihistaminic, and anti-adrenergic effects. They cause more side effects (dry mouth, constipation, orthostatic hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias) and are lethal in overdose.

They are effective for positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions) but have high risk of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), including tardive dyskinesia with long-term use. Atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics block both D2 dopamine and 5-HT2 serotonin receptors. They carry a lower risk of EPS and tardive dyskinesia but a higher risk of metabolic syndrome (weight gain, diabetes, dyslipidemia).

It is characterized by involuntary, repetitive movements — typically of the mouth, tongue, and face (lip smacking, tongue protrusion). It is often irreversible, caused by dopamine receptor supersensitivity after prolonged blockade. Akathisia is an early-onset EPS characterized by subjective restlessness and a compulsive need to move (pacing, shifting, rocking). It appears within days to weeks of starting an antipsychotic and is distressing but not a movement abnormality in the same structural sense.",

      "answer": "Retinal disparity is a binocular depth cue that results from the slightly different retinal images produced by the left and right eyes due to their horizontal separation. The brain computes depth from this difference, and it is most effective for objects at close distances. Monocular (pictorial) depth cues can be detected with a single eye and include interposition (overlap), relative size, texture gradient, linear perspective, aerial perspective, and motion parallax. These cues are used for distant objects and are the cues available to painters representing depth on a flat surface.",

They are highly concentrated at the periphery of the retina. Cones are photoreceptors that require more light to function; they are responsible for color vision and high visual acuity (fine detail).

      "question": "What is the difference between benzodiazepines and barbiturates as CNS depressants?",
      "answer": "Both benzodiazepines and barbiturates are sedative-hypnotics that enhance GABA-A receptor activity, but they differ in mechanism and safety profile. Benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, alprazolam, lorazepam) bind to a modulatory site on the GABA-A receptor and increase the frequency of chloride channel opening in the presence of GABA. They have a wide therapeutic index, making fatal overdose from benzodiazepines alone uncommon. They are the preferred class for treating anxiety, insomnia, seizures, and alcohol withdrawal. Barbiturates (e.g., phenobarbital, pentobarbital) bind to a different GABA-A site and directly increase the duration of chloride channel opening; at high doses they can activate the channel without GABA. Their narrow therapeutic index makes overdose and death much more likely, limiting their clinical use to specific seizure disorders and anesthesia induction.",

      "question": "What is the difference between tolerance and dependence in the context of psychoactive drug use?",
      "answer": "Tolerance is a pharmacological phenomenon in which repeated drug exposure produces a diminished response, requiring increasingly higher doses to achieve the same effect. It arises through two main mechanisms: pharmacokinetic tolerance (accelerated drug metabolism, often via enzyme induction) and pharmacodynamic tolerance (receptor downregulation or desensitization). Tolerance can develop independently of dependence. Dependence (physical dependence) is a state of neuroadaptation in which the body requires the drug to maintain normal functioning; abrupt discontinuation produces a characteristic withdrawal syndrome. For example, a patient on long-term benzodiazepines may become physically dependent and require a slow taper to avoid seizures on withdrawal. Dependence does not necessarily imply tolerance or addictive behavior.",

      "item_y": "Psychological dependence",
      "question": "What is the difference between physical dependence and psychological dependence on a psychoactive drug?",
      "answer": "Physical dependence is a neuroadaptive state in which the drug is required for normal physiological function; stopping the drug triggers measurable, often dangerous withdrawal symptoms. Examples include opioid withdrawal (muscle aches, sweating, vomiting), alcohol withdrawal (tremor, seizures, delirium tremens), and benzodiazepine withdrawal (anxiety, seizures). Medical supervision and gradual tapering are typically required. Psychological dependence refers to intense craving, compulsive drug-seeking, and continued use despite negative consequences, driven by the drug's reinforcing effects on the brain's reward system (mesolimbic dopamine pathway). It does not necessarily produce prominent physical withdrawal symptoms. Cocaine and amphetamines are prototypical examples: cessation causes profound craving and dysphoria but not severe physical withdrawal signs. Cannabis also produces primarily psychological dependence. In practice the two forms often co-occur.",

The old information 'pushes forward' and blocks acquisition of the new (e.g., speaking Spanish makes it harder to learn French vocabulary). Retroactive interference occurs when newly learned material interferes with memory for PREVIOUSLY learned information.

      "answer": "Maintenance (rote) rehearsal involves repeating information over and over without adding deeper meaning — it keeps information in short-term memory but does NOT effectively transfer it to long-term memory (e.g., repeating a phone number). Elaborative rehearsal involves linking new information to existing knowledge, creating meaningful associations, or processing information at a deeper level. This is far more effective for long-term retention. Craik & Lockhart's levels-of-processing model supports this: deeper (semantic, meaningful) processing produces better long-term memory than shallow (phonological) processing.",
