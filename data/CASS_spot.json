      "explanation": "The passage reversed the key relationship. The advantage of BR (Base Rate) scores is that they help avoid overdiagnosis of RARE disorders and underdiagnosis of COMMON ones. Without base rate calibration, instruments using standard T-scores may over-identify rare conditions and under-identify prevalent ones because the cutoff thresholds are not adjusted for actual prevalence rates. The modified passage swapped 'rare' and 'common,' reversing this important diagnostic concept."

The passage incorrectly attributes this model to Holland."

In a normal distribution, a percentile rank of 50 corresponds to the center of the distribution, which is a z-score of 0 (not 1). A z-score of 1 would correspond to approximately the 84th percentile. Note that the first distractor ('mean' should be 'median') is plausible-sounding but not actually an error here, because in a perfectly normal distribution the mean and the median are identical, so stating it corresponds to the mean is not incorrect."

A core principle of Motivational Interviewing is that it aims to enhance a client's intrinsic (internal) motivation for change, not extrinsic (external) motivation. The original publication by Miller & Rollnick (1991) and subsequent editions explicitly describe MI as designed to elicit and strengthen the client's own internal reasons for change. The other options describe elements that are actually correct in the passage: MI is indeed described as both 'client-centered' and 'directive,' and the 1991 date is accurate for the first edition of the foundational text."

Referring to K as the 'Correction' scale is actually a common convention in many textbooks. However, strictly speaking, the original supplementary validity scale sometimes confused with K is the S (Superlative Self-Presentation) scale. Let me correct this approach."
