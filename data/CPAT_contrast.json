      "question": "What is the difference between positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia?",
      "answer": "Positive symptoms represent the addition of abnormal experiences or behaviors: hallucinations (false perceptions), delusions (false beliefs, e.g., thought broadcasting, delusions of control), disorganized speech, and disorganized or catatonic behavior. They are thought to reflect dopamine hyperactivity in mesolimbic pathways. Negative symptoms represent the reduction or loss of normal functions: alogia (poverty of speech), affective flattening, avolition, anhedonia, and asociality. They are linked to prefrontal underactivity and are more resistant to treatment. Negative symptoms predict poorer long-term functional outcomes.",
      "key_distinction": "Positive = excess (hallucinations, delusions); Negative = deficit (flat affect, avolition, alogia).",

      "answer": "Brief psychotic disorder: psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech/behavior) last at least 1 day but less than 1 month, with full return to premorbid functioning. Schizophreniform disorder: same symptoms last at least 1 month but less than 6 months — a provisional diagnosis when the full duration of schizophrenia has not yet been met.

The person has no desire for intimacy and is indifferent to others' opinions. There are no unusual perceptions or beliefs. Schizotypal personality disorder includes social isolation but is additionally characterized by odd beliefs, magical thinking, ideas of reference, unusual perceptual experiences, and eccentric speech and behavior.

      "answer": "ADHD inattentive presentation is characterized predominantly by difficulty sustaining attention, distractibility, forgetfulness, losing things, and failure to follow through on tasks. It may go undiagnosed longer because the child is not disruptive. ADHD hyperactive-impulsive presentation is characterized predominantly by excessive motor activity, fidgeting, interrupting, difficulty waiting, and impulsive decision-making. In practice, most children have the combined presentation (both sets of symptoms). Adults require ≥5 symptoms (rather than the ≥6 required for under-17).",

      "answer": "OCD is an anxiety/OCD-related disorder characterized by ego-dystonic obsessions (intrusive, unwanted thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors or mental acts to reduce distress). The person recognizes their thoughts as senseless and is distressed by them. OCPD is a Cluster C personality disorder characterized by ego-syntonic preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and control.

The anxiety is acute and episodic. GAD involves persistent, excessive, and difficult-to-control worry about multiple areas (work, health, finances) occurring more days than not for ≥6 months, accompanied by at least 3 of: restlessness, fatigue, concentration difficulty, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance.

A hypomanic episode requires the same symptom types for ≥4 days, does NOT cause marked impairment, does NOT require hospitalization, and does NOT include psychotic features — the change is observable but the person may even feel productive. Bipolar I requires ≥1 manic episode. Bipolar II requires ≥1 hypomanic episode + ≥1 major depressive episode.",

Bipolar II disorder requires at least one hypomanic episode AND at least one major depressive episode — but NO full manic episode. If a manic episode occurs, the diagnosis must be changed to Bipolar I. Bipolar II is NOT a milder form of Bipolar I; it is associated with a high burden of depression and frequent episodes.",

It can be episodic and remit. Persistent depressive disorder (formerly dysthymia) requires a depressed mood present most of the day, more days than not, for at least 2 years (1 year for children/adolescents), with at least 2 additional symptoms (poor appetite/overeating, insomnia/hypersomnia, low energy, low self-esteem, poor concentration, hopelessness).

The person is genuinely indifferent to others and to social interaction; they neither seek nor enjoy close relationships, and are emotionally flat. Avoidant personality disorder involves an intense DESIRE for social relationships, but avoidance due to overwhelming fear of rejection, criticism, embarrassment, and humiliation. The person wants connection but believes they are inadequate and will be rejected. Schizoid = doesn't want relationships; Avoidant = wants them but fears rejection too much to pursue them.",

BPD is defined by unstable identity, unstable intense relationships with idealization/devaluation, fear of abandonment, self-harm, affective instability, and identity disturbance. Histrionic PD involves excessive emotionality and attention-seeking but with a more stable sense of identity, no self-harm, and relationships characterized by manipulation and shallow emotion rather than intense ambivalence.

      "answer": "Alcohol withdrawal is potentially life-threatening. It begins within hours of last drink and can progress to delirium tremens (DTs). Symptoms include autonomic hyperactivity, hand tremor, insomnia, transient hallucinations, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. DTs (peaking 24–72 hours) include confusion, agitation, fever, and cardiovascular instability — and can be fatal without treatment. Treatment: benzodiazepines. Opioid withdrawal is profoundly uncomfortable but generally not life-threatening. Symptoms resemble severe influenza: muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dilated pupils (mydriasis), piloerection (goosebumps), restlessness, insomnia, yawning, and anxiety.",

      "answer": "Alzheimer's NCD typically begins with insidious memory loss as the predominant early symptom; motor symptoms are less prominent early. It follows a gradually progressive course. Sundowning (symptom worsening in evenings) is characteristic. Lewy Body NCD is characterized by early motor disturbances (Parkinsonism — rigidity, tremor, bradykinesia), prominent fluctuating cognition, recurrent visual hallucinations, and REM sleep behavior disorder. Motor problems are a more important early cause of disability in Lewy Body than in Alzheimer's. Parkinson's NCD differs from Lewy Body in that it begins after a well-established history of motor symptoms.",

      "answer": "Delirium is characterized by acute onset (hours to days), fluctuating disturbance of attention and awareness, and disorganized thinking. It is almost always caused by a medical condition (infection, metabolic disturbance, medication), and it is reversible with treatment of the underlying cause. Neurocognitive disorder (dementia) has a gradual, insidious onset with progressive decline in cognitive domains without fluctuating consciousness in the classic presentation. It is largely irreversible (though progression may be slowed). Sundowning in NCD may look like delirium; the key is the chronic progressive course vs. the acute fluctuating course of delirium.",

It often predicts later PTSD but is distinct. PTSD involves similar symptoms but lasts more than 1 month (symptoms persist or begin after the 1-month mark).

Physical symptoms are present and may or may not have a medical explanation. Illness anxiety disorder (formerly hypochondriasis) involves preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness, but somatic symptoms are ABSENT or, if present, are only mild.

      "question": "What is the difference between reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder?",
      "answer": "Both disorders arise from a history of social neglect or insufficient caregiving. RAD involves inhibited, emotionally withdrawn behavior — the child consistently does not seek comfort from adult caregivers when distressed and rarely expresses positive emotions. The pattern reflects a failure to form an attachment. DSED involves a pattern of disinhibited, overly familiar behavior with unfamiliar adults — approaching strangers, willingness to go off with strangers, reduced wariness. Despite the name, children with DSED may have attachments to caregivers; the disorder reflects social indiscriminacy, not absence of attachment.",

It is a less severe precursor. Conduct disorder involves more serious violations of social norms and the rights of others: aggression to people and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness/theft, and serious rule violations (e.g., truancy, running away).

These individuals account for a disproportionate share of serious crime. Adolescent-limited (AL) antisocial behavior emerges in adolescence (explained by Moffitt's 'maturity gap' — the gap between biological maturity and social autonomy), peaks in mid-adolescence, and largely desists in early adulthood as adult roles and opportunities increase.

BMI is significantly below normal. It has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. Bulimia nervosa involves recurrent binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors (purging, fasting, excessive exercise) to prevent weight gain. Body weight is typically normal or above normal. Unlike anorexia, bulimia does not require low body weight — in fact, low weight would shift diagnosis to anorexia. Both involve distorted body image.",

The critical difference is that bulimia nervosa includes recurrent compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain (self-induced vomiting, laxative misuse, excessive exercise, fasting), while BED does NOT include compensatory behaviors. BED is associated with marked distress about the bingeing itself. Evidence-based treatments for BED include CBT and interpersonal psychotherapy.",

Severity is rated mild (2-3 criteria), moderate (4-5), or severe (6+). SUD reflects a persistent condition, not a momentary state. Substance intoxication is an acute, time-limited, reversible syndrome resulting from recent ingestion of a substance, producing clinically significant maladaptive behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., impaired judgment, altered perception, mood changes). Intoxication resolves as the substance is metabolized. A person can experience intoxication without having a use disorder, and a person in remission from SUD can still become intoxicated.",

CRAFT trains CSOs to use positive reinforcement to encourage sober behavior, allow natural consequences when the identified patient (IP) uses substances, and make strategic requests for the IP to enter treatment. CRAFT also helps CSOs improve their own quality of life independent of the IP. It has the strongest evidence base for engaging treatment-refusing individuals (~64-74% engagement rates). Al-Anon is a 12-step mutual support program for family members emphasizing acceptance, detachment with love, and the three Cs (did not Cause it, cannot Control it, cannot Cure it). It is grounded in the disease model and focuses on the CSO's own recovery and emotional well-being rather than actively changing the IP's behavior.",

Having a paraphilia alone is NOT sufficient for a mental disorder diagnosis and does not require clinical intervention. A paraphilic disorder exists when the paraphilia (1) causes clinically significant distress or functional impairment to the individual, OR (2) involves sexual behaviors with persons who cannot or do not consent (e.g., pedophilic disorder, frotteuristic disorder).

It is a descriptive term for variation in gender expression and is NOT a mental disorder. Many transgender, non-binary, and gender-diverse individuals are gender-nonconforming without experiencing distress or impairment. Gender dysphoria (DSM-5 diagnosis) requires a marked incongruence between an individual's experienced/expressed gender and their assigned gender, causing clinically significant distress or functional impairment, with a minimum duration of 6 months. The presence of gender incongruence alone is not sufficient -- the distress or functional impairment criterion must be met.
