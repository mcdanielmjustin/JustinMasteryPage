Absolute measures evaluate individuals against fixed standards or rubrics, leaving raters more prone to applying leniency, strictness, or central tendency patterns consistently across all employees.

Employees may feel unfairly ranked if they do not understand that relative measures force differentiation by design, rather than reflecting true performance against universal standards. Additionally, relative measures can be problematic when an entire group performs exceptionally well; forcing rank ordering in such cases may artificially create perceived performance gaps that do not reflect reality.

If trainees view the model as too distant or unlike themselves, they may doubt their own capability to replicate the behaviors despite seeing them performed.

Adverse impact refers to hiring or selection outcomes that disproportionately affect protected classes, while differential validity refers to a test having different validity coefficients across groups.

If a test predicts job performance differently across groups, applying a single cut-off score may disadvantage one group.
