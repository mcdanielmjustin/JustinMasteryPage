When the 14-year-old's adolescent behavior threatens the parents' established family equilibrium, their response to treat him like a younger child and increase punishment reflects an attempt to counteract this change and preserve the original system structure.

In the anchor point example, negative feedback (parental control and punishment) resists the son's adolescent development to preserve the old system.

Rather than successfully restoring equilibrium, this response often escalates conflict, generates resentment, and may lead to symptom development in the identified patient or other family members. The parents' punitive stance does not eliminate the adolescent's developmental needs; rather, it can drive those needs underground or create rebellion, paradoxically destabilizing the system further. This illustrates why family therapy often aims to introduce flexibility alongside stability.","legacy_domain_code":"CLI","legacy_domain_name":"Clinical Psychology"},{"id":"JQ-CLI-185-direct_recall","source_question_id":"185","source_exam":"Exam 1","source_question_number":45,"source_summary":"Providing psychotherapy to patients reduces expenditures on medical care, as demonstrated by research on medical cost offset.","domain_code":"PTHE","domain_name":"Psychotherapy Models, Interventions & Prevention","subdomain":"Prevention, Consultation, and Psychotherapy Research","angle":"direct_recall","question":"The medical cost offset phenomenon refers to which of the following findings?","options":{"A":"Psychotherapy reduces overall healthcare expenditures by decreasing medical service utilization","B":"Patients who receive psychotherapy require longer treatment durations than those receiving medication alone","C":"Insurance companies must offset the cost of mental health services by raising premiums on medical plans","D":"Psychological interventions are more expensive than traditional medical treatments but improve patient satisfaction"},"correct_answer":"A","explanation":"Medical cost offset describes the empirically demonstrated finding that psychotherapy reduces healthcare costs overall, particularly by decreasing unnecessary medical visits and procedures.
