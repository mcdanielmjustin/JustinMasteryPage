(2) Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder — cannabis (particularly high-THC varieties) can induce a psychotic episode indistinguishable from Schizophrenia; toxicology and timeline are critical.

          "correct_answer": "B",
          "explanation": "Directly confronting delusions typically increases defensiveness and damages rapport without changing beliefs — psychotic beliefs are not amenable to logical persuasion. Motivational engagement acknowledges the patient's subjective distress (e.g., 'It sounds like you've been through a lot and haven't slept in days') to build alliance without reinforcing or disputing the content of the delusions. This allows treatment to proceed while preserving the therapeutic relationship.",
          "distractor_rationale": {
            "A": "Confronting or arguing against delusions is contraindicated — it is ineffective and typically escalates agitation and mistrust.",
