      "question": "What is the difference between Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Alderfer's ERG theory?",
      "answer": "Maslow proposed five needs arranged in a strict hierarchy (physiological, safety, love/belonging, esteem, self-actualization) that must be satisfied from bottom to top — lower needs must be met before higher needs motivate. Only one need is motivating at a time. Alderfer's ERG theory collapses Maslow's five into three: Existence (physiological + safety), Relatedness (social + esteem from others), and Growth (self-esteem + actualization). ERG theory differs in that: multiple needs can be active simultaneously, there is a frustration-regression principle (when a higher need is frustrated, the person regresses to a lower need), and there is no strict hierarchical progression required.",
      "key_distinction": "Maslow = strict hierarchy, one need at a time, bottom-up only; ERG = flexible, multiple concurrent needs, frustration-regression allowed.",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Both are content theories of motivation with hierarchical elements; the key differences (concurrent needs, frustration-regression) are easily overlooked.",

      "question": "What is the difference between Herzberg's hygiene factors and motivators?",
      "answer": "Herzberg's two-factor theory proposes that job satisfaction and dissatisfaction are caused by different factors. Hygiene (maintenance) factors — salary, working conditions, company policy, supervision, job security — prevent dissatisfaction when adequate but do NOT create satisfaction or motivation when improved. Improving hygiene only moves workers from dissatisfied to neutral. Motivators — achievement, recognition, the work itself, responsibility, advancement, and growth — are intrinsic to the job and actively create satisfaction and motivation. Herzberg's prescription: to truly motivate workers, enrich their jobs with motivators; simply improving hygiene (e.g., a pay raise) will not motivate.",
      "key_distinction": "Hygiene = prevent dissatisfaction (extrinsic); Motivators = create satisfaction (intrinsic).",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Students assume salary is the primary motivator; Herzberg's counterintuitive finding is that salary prevents dissatisfaction but doesn't create motivation.",

      "answer": "Theory X assumes that workers are inherently lazy, dislike work, avoid responsibility, must be coerced, controlled, and threatened to achieve organizational goals, and are primarily motivated by extrinsic rewards (money, avoiding punishment). Theory X managers tend toward authoritarian, close supervision. Theory Y assumes that workers find work as natural as rest or play, seek responsibility, are capable of self-direction, are motivated by intrinsic rewards (self-actualization), and creativity/problem-solving abilities are widely distributed. Theory Y managers tend toward participatory, empowering management styles.",

      "question": "What is the difference between transformational and transactional leadership?",
      "answer": "Transformational leadership motivates followers by inspiring a shared vision, challenging them to exceed their self-interest for the good of the organization, appealing to higher-order needs, and stimulating intellectual growth. Transformational leaders produce change through charisma, inspiration, individualized consideration, and intellectual stimulation. Transactional leadership is based on exchange — leaders provide contingent rewards (or punishments) in return for specific behaviors and performance. Management by exception (active or passive) is a transactional approach. Transactional leadership maintains rather than transforms; transformational leadership produces organizational change and extraordinary performance.",
      "key_distinction": "Transformational = inspire/change through vision and values; Transactional = manage through rewards/punishments for compliance.",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Both are about how leaders influence followers; students may not clearly distinguish inspirational change-orientation from exchange-based management.",

      "question": "What is the difference between high LPC and low LPC leaders in Fiedler's contingency theory?",
      "answer": "Fiedler's LPC (Least Preferred Coworker) scale measures leadership style by asking leaders to rate their least preferred coworker. High LPC leaders give their least preferred coworker relatively favorable ratings, indicating a relationship-oriented style (the leader can separate task from interpersonal regard). These leaders are most effective in moderately favorable situations. Low LPC leaders give their least preferred coworker very unfavorable ratings, indicating a task-oriented style. These leaders are most effective in either very favorable (good control) or very unfavorable (poor control) situations.",

      "question": "What is the difference between behavioral and situational employment interviews?",
      "answer": "Behavioral interviews ask applicants about their past behavior in job-relevant situations ('Tell me about a time when you handled a difficult customer'). They are based on the assumption that past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior. They are most valid for applicants with relevant experience. Situational interviews ask applicants how they would handle hypothetical future job-relevant scenarios ('What would you do if a customer became angry and started threatening you?'). They assess intentions and judgment. Both are structured interview formats and have higher validity than unstructured interviews. Situational interviews may work better for inexperienced applicants.",

      "item_y": "Predictive criterion-related validity",
      "question": "What is the difference between concurrent and predictive criterion-related validity in personnel selection?",
      "answer": "Concurrent validity is assessed by administering a selection test to CURRENT employees and correlating their test scores with their CURRENT job performance. The predictor and criterion are measured simultaneously. It is faster and cheaper but may be biased because current employees may differ systematically from job applicants. Predictive validity is assessed by administering a selection test to JOB APPLICANTS, hiring them without using the test results, and then correlating test scores with their FUTURE job performance measured later. The predictor precedes the criterion in time. Predictive validity is the gold standard because it directly addresses the purpose of selection testing.",
      "key_distinction": "Concurrent = test and criterion measured at same time (current employees); Predictive = test now, measure criterion later (applicants).",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Both are criterion-related validity types; students confuse which involves current employees vs. applicants and which is the gold standard.",

      "item_y": "Relative performance appraisal measures",
      "question": "What is the difference between absolute and relative performance appraisal methods?",
      "answer": "Absolute (individual) performance appraisal measures evaluate each employee against a fixed standard or set of criteria, independent of how other employees perform (e.g., behaviorally anchored rating scales, graphic rating scales, MBO). They provide detailed feedback but are susceptible to rater biases like leniency, strictness, and central tendency. Relative (comparative) performance measures evaluate employees by comparing them to one another (e.g., ranking, paired comparison, forced distribution). They reduce leniency, strictness, and central tendency biases but provide less diagnostic information and can damage morale.",
      "key_distinction": "Absolute = compare to a standard; Relative = compare to other employees.",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Students may not recognize why relative methods reduce leniency bias (you can't rank everyone at the top) while absolute methods allow it.",

      "item_y": "Distributed (spaced) practice",
      "question": "What is the difference between massed and distributed practice in training?",
      "answer": "Massed (blocked) practice involves learning or training conducted in one long, continuous session without breaks. Distributed (spaced) practice involves the same total amount of training spread over multiple shorter sessions with rest intervals between them. Research consistently shows that distributed practice produces better long-term retention and skill transfer than massed practice, especially for complex skills. Massed practice may produce faster initial performance but leads to more rapid forgetting. The spacing effect is one of the most robust findings in learning and memory research.",
      "key_distinction": "Massed = one long session, faster initial learning, poorer retention; Distributed/spaced = multiple sessions, slower initially, superior long-term retention.",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Students study in massed sessions (cramming) and see short-term results, leading to the misconception that massed practice is superior.",

      "item_y": "Group polarization",
      "question": "What is the difference between groupthink and group polarization?",
      "answer": "Groupthink (Janis) is a phenomenon where the desire for group cohesion and consensus suppresses critical thinking, dissent, and evaluation of alternatives. It produces poor-quality decisions through illusions of invulnerability, collective rationalization, and self-censorship. It most likely occurs in cohesive groups with directive leaders under stress, insulated from outside information. Group polarization refers to the tendency for group discussion to cause individuals to shift toward MORE extreme positions than they held before the discussion — either riskier (risky shift) or more cautious. It occurs because group discussion exposes members to more arguments favoring the dominant initial position.",
      "key_distinction": "Groupthink = convergence toward premature consensus, poor decision quality; Group polarization = shift toward more extreme positions after discussion.",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Both involve group influence on individual judgment; students conflate the mechanism (suppressed dissent vs. amplified initial tendency).",

      "question": "What is the difference between distributive and procedural justice in organizational settings?",
      "answer": "Distributive justice refers to the perceived fairness of the OUTCOMES of organizational decisions (e.g., is my pay fair relative to my effort and compared to my coworkers?). It addresses the 'what' of the decision. Procedural justice refers to the perceived fairness of the PROCESS by which decisions are made (e.g., were employees consulted? Was the process consistent and unbiased?). It addresses the 'how' of the decision. Research shows that procedural justice often matters more to employee satisfaction and trust than distributive justice — employees tolerate unfavorable outcomes if the process was fair.",
      "key_distinction": "Distributive = fairness of the outcome; Procedural = fairness of the decision-making process.",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Both are types of organizational justice; students may not appreciate that process fairness (procedural) often predicts satisfaction better than outcome fairness (distributive).",

      "question": "What is the difference between Weber's bureaucracy theory and Taylor's scientific management?",
      "answer": "Weber's bureaucracy theory describes the ideal rational organization structure: division of labor, hierarchical authority, formal rules and procedures, impersonal relationships, and career advancement based on technical qualifications. It is a macro-level, sociological theory of organizational structure. Taylor's scientific management focuses on maximizing worker productivity through systematic analysis of work tasks (time-and-motion studies), standardization of tools and methods, selection and training of workers for specific tasks, and linking pay directly to productivity (differential piece-rate system). It is a micro-level, engineering approach to work design. Taylor believed economic gain was the primary worker motivation.",
      "key_distinction": "Weber = rational organizational structure (bureaucracy); Taylor = scientific optimization of individual work tasks for productivity.",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Both are classical organizational theories from the early 20th century and students may not distinguish their focus levels (structure vs. work tasks).",
