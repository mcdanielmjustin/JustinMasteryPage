      "question": "What is the difference between transference and countertransference?",
      "answer": "Transference occurs when a client projects feelings, expectations, or attitudes from important past relationships onto the therapist. For example, a client who had a critical father may become angry and defensive toward a therapist who gives gentle feedback. Transference is considered a key source of therapeutic material in psychodynamic therapy. Countertransference occurs when the therapist unconsciously projects their own feelings, conflicts, or past relationships onto the client. Modern psychodynamic thinking views countertransference as a source of information about the therapeutic relationship, but it must be managed to avoid harmful reactions.",

      "item_y": "Psychodynamic therapy",
      "question": "What is the difference between classical psychoanalysis and psychodynamic therapy?",
      "answer": "Classical psychoanalysis (Freud) is intensive — typically 4–5 sessions per week. The client lies on a couch using free association; the analyst remains largely silent. Techniques include dream analysis, interpretation of resistance and transference, and working through. It is long-term (years). Psychodynamic therapy is a more flexible, shorter-term derivative. Sessions are face-to-face, typically weekly, and the therapist is more active and interactive. Focus is still on unconscious conflicts, interpersonal patterns, and transference, but less rigidly structured. It has more empirical support due to easier study.",

      "question": "What is the difference between Beck's cognitive therapy and Ellis's Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT)?",
      "answer": "Beck's cognitive therapy (CT) focuses on identifying and testing specific automatic thoughts and cognitive distortions using collaborative empiricism (Socratic questioning). The therapist helps the client examine evidence for and against distorted beliefs and develop more adaptive thoughts. Beck's cognitive triad for depression: negative views of self, world, and future. REBT (Ellis) focuses on identifying and disputing irrational beliefs — absolute, demanding thoughts ('must,' 'should,' 'ought'). Ellis's ABC model: Activating event → irrational Belief → emotional/behavioral Consequence. The therapist is more direct and confrontational in disputing irrational beliefs than in CT.",
      "key_distinction": "Beck's CT = Socratic empirical testing of specific thoughts; REBT = direct disputation of absolute irrational beliefs.",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Both are cognitive therapies targeting distorted thinking, but the mechanism (empirical testing vs. direct disputation) and theoretical emphasis differ.",

      "question": "What is the difference between automatic thoughts and core beliefs (schemas) in Beck's cognitive theory?",
      "answer": "Automatic thoughts are the spontaneous, surface-level cognitions that pop into awareness in response to a situation — brief and specific (e.g., 'I'm going to fail this test,' 'Nobody likes me'). They are the most accessible level and the usual starting point in CBT. Core beliefs are deeper, more fundamental assumptions or schemas about the self, others, and the world that give rise to automatic thoughts (e.g., 'I am incompetent,' 'People will always abandon me'). Intermediate beliefs (attitudes, rules, assumptions) sit between core beliefs and automatic thoughts. CBT addresses automatic thoughts first, then works deeper toward core beliefs.",
      "key_distinction": "Automatic thoughts = surface level, situation-specific; Core beliefs/schemas = deep, global, foundational assumptions.",

      "question": "What is the difference between solution-focused and problem-focused approaches to therapy?",
      "answer": "Solution-focused brief therapy (de Shazer, O'Hanlon) actively steers away from detailed analysis of problems and instead focuses on times when the problem is absent or less severe (exceptions), client strengths, and what the client wants to be different (preferred future). The miracle question ('If a miracle happened overnight, what would be different?') is a hallmark technique. Problem-focused approaches explore the nature, history, and causes of the problem in detail, under the assumption that understanding the problem is necessary for resolving it. Solution-focused therapy emphasizes that understanding the cause of a problem is not necessary to solve it.",
      "key_distinction": "Solution-focused = future-oriented, builds on strengths and exceptions; Problem-focused = analyzes cause and history of the problem.",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Students sometimes confuse 'solution-focused' with 'problem-solving therapy,' which is a different evidence-based intervention.",

      "question": "What is the difference between structural and strategic family therapy?",
      "answer": "Structural family therapy (Minuchin) focuses on changing the structure and organization of the family system — specifically the boundaries between subsystems (spousal, parental, sibling). The goal is to establish clear, flexible boundaries. Techniques include joining the family, enactment, and boundary-making. Problems are seen as arising from enmeshed or disengaged family structure. Strategic family therapy (Haley, Madanes) focuses on changing specific problematic sequences of behavior and communication through directives and tasks assigned between sessions. Paradoxical interventions (prescribing the symptom) are a hallmark. The therapist takes a more directive role.",
      "key_distinction": "Structural = reorganize family boundaries and subsystems; Strategic = assign directives/tasks to change behavioral sequences.",

      "question": "What is the difference between enmeshment and disengagement in Minuchin's structural family therapy?",
      "answer": "Enmeshment describes family subsystem boundaries that are diffuse and overly porous — members are too close, overly involved in each other's lives, with little individuality or autonomy. A parent is overly involved in a child's emotional life, cannot separate their own distress from the child's. Disengagement describes boundaries that are overly rigid — members are disconnected, unsupportive, with limited communication between subsystems. Parents may be unaware of or uninvolved in the child's activities and problems. The therapeutic goal is to move toward clear but flexible ('normal') boundaries between the two extremes.",
      "key_distinction": "Enmeshment = too close, diffuse boundaries; Disengagement = too distant, rigid boundaries.",

      "question": "What is the difference between primary and secondary prevention (Caplan)?",
      "answer": "Primary prevention aims to prevent the development of a disorder in the general population before it occurs — targeting risk factors and building protective factors in people who currently have no disorder (e.g., school-based anti-drug education). Secondary prevention focuses on early identification and prompt intervention to reduce the duration and severity of existing problems. It targets at-risk individuals or those in early stages of a disorder (e.g., screening programs, early intervention). Tertiary prevention aims to reduce disability and impairment from established, chronic disorders.",

      "item_y": "Flooding",
      "question": "What is the difference between exposure with response prevention (ERP) and flooding?",
      "answer": "Exposure with response prevention (ERP) is the gold-standard treatment for OCD. It involves graduated or full exposure to feared stimuli while preventing the usual compulsive response, allowing anxiety to extinguish naturally without the ritual reinforcing it. The response prevention component is essential — without it, the ritual would reduce anxiety and reinforce the OCD cycle. Flooding involves exposure to the most feared stimulus at full intensity from the start (in vivo or imaginal), without a graduated hierarchy. It is used for phobias and PTSD. Neither allows escape; the distinction is the systematic prevention of compulsive rituals (ERP) vs. intense immediate exposure without rituals (flooding).",
      "key_distinction": "ERP = exposure + blocking compulsive responses (OCD-specific); Flooding = immediate full-intensity exposure (phobias/PTSD, no ritual-blocking needed).",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Both involve exposure and preventing escape/avoidance; the unique ritual-prevention component of ERP is what distinguishes it from generic flooding.",

      "question": "What is the difference between the precontemplation and contemplation stages in the transtheoretical model?",
      "answer": "In the Precontemplation stage, the person is not aware of or not acknowledging their problem, and has no intention to change behavior in the next 6 months. They may feel resigned or demoralized. Motivational interviewing approaches and consciousness-raising (psychoeducation) are appropriate interventions. In the Contemplation stage, the person is aware that a problem exists and is considering change within the next 6 months but is ambivalent and not yet committed to action. Motivational interviewing and decisional balancing (exploring pros and cons) are most effective here.",

      "question": "What is the difference between efficacy research and effectiveness research in psychotherapy?",
      "answer": "Efficacy research tests whether a treatment produces better outcomes than a control condition under tightly controlled, ideal conditions — typically randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with carefully screened, homogeneous samples, manualized treatment, trained research therapists, and strict adherence monitoring. The goal is to maximize internal validity. Effectiveness research tests whether a treatment works in real-world clinical settings with diverse patients, typical clinicians, and naturalistic conditions — without the rigid constraints of an RCT. The goal is to maximize external validity (generalizability). Most empirically supported treatments (ESTs) are initially validated through efficacy trials, but their real-world applicability is evaluated through effectiveness studies.",

      "question": "What is the difference between consultation and collaboration as professional service models?",
      "answer": "In consultation, a consultant (typically a psychologist) provides expert advice to a consultee (e.g., a teacher, physician, or case manager) about a client or program. The consultant does not take direct responsibility for the client — the consultee retains full responsibility for implementing recommendations. The relationship is triadic (consultant–consultee–client). In collaboration, two or more professionals work together as co-equals, sharing responsibility for planning, decision-making, and outcomes. Neither party holds a distinct expert role; both contribute jointly. Caplan identified four types of mental health consultation: client-centered case, consultee-centered case, program-centered administrative, and consultee-centered administrative.",

      "question": "What is the difference between systematic desensitization and flooding as treatments for fear/phobia?",
      "answer": "Systematic desensitization (Wolpe) uses a gradual, hierarchical approach: the client is taught progressive muscle relaxation, constructs an anxiety hierarchy from least to most fear-provoking, and is then progressively exposed to feared stimuli while maintaining relaxation (imaginal or in vivo). The procedure is slow, graduated, and the client controls the pace. Flooding involves immediate, full-intensity exposure to the most feared stimulus (in vivo or imaginal) without gradual build-up and without escape. The client remains in the feared situation until anxiety naturally extinguishes. It is faster but more distressing. Dismantling studies show systematic desensitization's effectiveness is due to extinction, not reciprocal inhibition (relaxation is not essential).",
      "key_distinction": "Systematic desensitization = graduated hierarchy + relaxation; Flooding = immediate, maximum intensity exposure.",

      "question": "What is the difference between shaping and chaining in behavioral interventions?",
      "answer": "Shaping involves reinforcing successive approximations to a target behavior that does not yet exist in the person's repertoire. Each small step toward the final behavior is reinforced, and the criterion is progressively raised. It is used to build a new behavior from scratch (e.g., teaching a child with ASD to wave goodbye). Chaining involves breaking a complex behavior sequence into individual steps and systematically linking them together. In forward chaining, the first step is taught first; in backward chaining, the last step is taught first. Shaping builds a single new response; chaining links pre-existing responses in a sequence.",
      "key_distinction": "Shaping = build a new behavior through successive approximations; Chaining = link existing behaviors in a sequence.",

      "answer": "A token economy is a behavior modification system in which tokens (secondary reinforcers) are earned for specified target behaviors and exchanged for backup reinforcers (goods, privileges). It is typically used with groups (e.g., inpatient units, classrooms) and is managed by staff. The individual has limited input into the system's design. A contingency contract (behavioral contract) is a written, negotiated agreement between two parties (often therapist and client, or parent and child) that specifies: target behaviors, consequences for achieving or not achieving them, and signatures. The client has active input. Both use positive reinforcement principles.",

      "question": "What is the difference between in vivo desensitization and imaginal desensitization?",
      "answer": "Both are forms of systematic desensitization (Wolpe) that pair graduated exposure to feared stimuli with a relaxation response to extinguish the conditioned fear. In vivo desensitization involves direct, real-world exposure to the actual feared stimulus or situation (e.g., a client with a dog phobia progressively approaches and eventually handles a real dog while remaining relaxed). This produces stronger extinction and generalization because the conditioned stimulus is encountered in its natural form. Imaginal desensitization involves vividly imagining the feared stimulus rather than confronting it in reality (e.g., the client pictures a dog at varying distances while relaxed). It is used when in vivo exposure is impractical, unsafe, or too distressing at the outset — for example, exposure to feared situations involving flying, surgery, or natural disasters. In vivo desensitization is generally considered more effective because it provides direct contact with the real CS; imaginal desensitization is preferred when real exposure is not yet feasible.",
      "key_distinction": "In vivo = real-world exposure to actual feared stimulus; Imaginal = exposure through vivid mental imagery.",
