      "question": "What is the difference between assimilation and accommodation in Piaget's theory?",
      "answer": "Assimilation occurs when new information or experiences are incorporated into existing schemas without changing the schema. The child interprets the new experience through the lens of what they already know (e.g., calling all four-legged animals 'doggie'). Accommodation occurs when an existing schema must be modified or a new schema created to fit new information that doesn't match the existing schema (e.g., learning that cats and dogs are different). Equilibration is the balance between the two.",
      "key_distinction": "Assimilation = fit new info into existing schema; Accommodation = change the schema to fit new info.",

      "answer": "Piaget viewed cognitive development as a biologically driven, individual process of constructing knowledge through direct interaction with the physical environment. Development follows universal, invariant stages driven by maturation, and language follows cognitive development. Vygotsky emphasized the social and cultural context as the primary driver of cognitive development. Learning occurs first in the social plane (between people) and then is internalized. The Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) describes what children can learn with guidance. Language precedes and drives thought in Vygotsky's view.",

      "question": "What is the difference between Piaget's concrete operational and formal operational stages?",
      "answer": "In the concrete operational stage (roughly 7–12 years), children can reason logically about concrete, tangible objects and events. They master conservation, can classify objects, understand seriation, and can reverse mental operations — but only with physical, real-world content. In the formal operational stage (12+ years), children can reason abstractly and hypothetically without needing concrete objects. They can engage in hypothetical-deductive reasoning, consider multiple possibilities, and think about abstract concepts such as justice, morality, and algebraic variables.",

      "answer": "Overextension occurs when a child uses a word to refer to a broader set of objects than the word actually covers (e.g., calling all men 'daddy' or all round objects 'ball'). It reflects applying a concept too broadly. Underextension occurs when a child uses a word to refer to a narrower set than the word actually covers (e.g., using 'dog' only to refer to the family pet, not to other dogs). Both are normal phases in early word learning as children refine their conceptual categories.",

      "answer": "A phoneme is the smallest unit of sound in a language that can distinguish meaning (e.g., the sounds /b/ and /p/ in 'bat' vs. 'pat'). English has about 44 phonemes. A morpheme is the smallest unit of meaning in a language (e.g., 'un-' + 'kind' + '-ness' = 3 morphemes).

      "answer": "In Ainsworth's strange situation, infants with avoidant attachment show little distress when separated from the caregiver, do not seek contact upon reunion, and appear indifferent to the caregiver's presence or absence. Physiological measures show these infants are stressed but have learned not to signal distress. Infants with anxious/ambivalent (resistant) attachment are extremely distressed at separation but are difficult to comfort at reunion — showing a mix of clinging and angry rejection. Their caregivers have been inconsistent and unpredictable.",

      "answer": "Stranger anxiety is fear and wariness in the presence of unfamiliar people. It emerges around 6–8 months of age and peaks around 8–10 months, coinciding with object permanence development. Separation anxiety is distress at being separated from the primary caregiver. It typically peaks around 12–18 months. Both are normal developmental milestones that reflect increasing cognitive awareness — the infant can now recognize familiar vs. unfamiliar people and anticipate the caregiver's absence.",

      "question": "What is the difference between heteronomous and autonomous moral reasoning in Piaget's theory?",
      "answer": "In heteronomous moral reasoning (roughly ages 5–10), children judge the morality of an action based on its consequences (amount of damage done) rather than the actor's intent. Rules are seen as sacred, fixed by authority, and unbreakable — a child who breaks 10 cups accidentally is judged worse than one who breaks 1 cup on purpose. In autonomous moral reasoning (10+ years), children understand that rules are social agreements that can be changed, and they weigh the intention behind an action more heavily than its outcome.",

      "answer": "Kohlberg's theory focused on justice reasoning — adherence to abstract principles of rights, fairness, and universal ethical laws. His stages were developed primarily from research on males and were critiqued for gender bias. Gilligan proposed that women (and some men) reason morally through an ethics of care — emphasizing context, relationships, and responsibility to avoid harm, rather than abstract justice.

Parents explain rules, listen to children, enforce boundaries with reasoning, and respond to emotional needs. Associated with the best outcomes: higher self-esteem, academic achievement, social competence. Authoritarian parenting combines low warmth with high control and strict obedience demands. Rules are set without explanation ('because I said so'), and punishment is common. Associated with lower self-esteem and poorer social skills in children.",

      "answer": "Shared environmental influences are aspects of the environment that are common to all siblings in a family (e.g., family SES, parenting style, neighborhood). They make siblings more similar to one another. Twin and adoption studies show that shared environmental influences on intelligence DECREASE after adolescence, while genetic influences INCREASE. Non-shared environmental influences are aspects of the environment that differ between siblings (e.g., different peer groups, different teachers, different birth order experiences). These make siblings more different from one another and explain why siblings in the same family often turn out quite differently.",

      "answer": "Social learning theory (Bandura) explains gender development through observational learning, modeling of same-sex adults and peers, and differential reinforcement of gender-appropriate behaviors by parents and society. Gender schema theory (Bem) proposes that children cognitively construct schemas for what is 'male' and 'female' based on their culture, and then filter new information and self-concept through these schemas — incorporating cognitive developmental theory with social learning. Both explanations contribute: social learning addresses the mechanism of acquisition, while schema theory adds the cognitive organizing framework.",

      "question": "What is the difference between cephalocaudal and proximodistal development?",
      "answer": "Cephalocaudal development refers to the directional pattern in which physical growth and motor control proceed from the head (cephalic end) downward toward the feet (caudal end). Infants gain control of the head and neck before the trunk, and the trunk before the legs. Proximodistal development refers to the directional pattern in which growth and motor control proceed from the center (proximal) of the body outward toward the extremities (distal). Infants gain control of the shoulder and upper arm before the hands, and the hands before the fingers. Both principles describe directional sequences of physical maturation and apply simultaneously during prenatal and postnatal development.",

      "answer": "Gross motor skills involve large muscle groups and whole-body movements — walking, running, jumping, climbing, throwing, and catching. They develop earlier in infancy and childhood, follow cephalocaudal and proximodistal sequences, and form the foundation for physical independence. Fine motor skills involve small muscle groups, particularly the hands and fingers — grasping, pinching, drawing, writing, and manipulating small objects. They emerge later than gross motor skills and require greater neural maturation plus integration of visual and hand movement (eye-hand coordination). Fine motor development also follows a proximodistal progression, with shoulder control preceding finger control.",

      "answer": "Permissive parenting (also called indulgent parenting) is characterized by high warmth and responsiveness combined with low demands and few behavioral rules. Parents are nurturing and accepting but rarely set limits or enforce consequences. Children of permissive parents often show poor impulse control and difficulty with authority, but typically have higher self-esteem and better social skills. Uninvolved (neglectful) parenting combines low warmth with low demands and minimal parental engagement. Parents are detached, unresponsive, and invest little emotional or practical support. This pattern is associated with the poorest developmental outcomes across all domains: poor academic performance, behavioral problems, low self-esteem, and insecure attachment.",

      "commonly_confused_because": "Both parenting styles have low behavioral demands and few rules, so students conflate them. The critical difference is warmth: permissive parents are emotionally present and caring, while uninvolved parents are disengaged.",

      "answer": "The Pygmalion effect (also called the Rosenthal effect or teacher expectancy effect) is an interpersonal expectancy effect: a teacher's high or low expectations of a student influence that student's actual performance. When teachers hold higher expectations — even based on arbitrary information — students tend to achieve more; lower expectations lead to underperformance. The Galatea effect is an intrapersonal (self-expectancy) effect: individuals who hold high expectations of themselves tend to perform better, functioning as a self-fulfilling prophecy driven by one's own beliefs. Both effects demonstrate how expectations shape outcomes, but the source of the expectation differs: external (another person) vs. internal (oneself).",

      "question": "What is the difference between the embryonic stage and the fetal stage of prenatal development?",
      "answer": "The embryonic stage spans approximately weeks 3 through 8 after conception. During this period, the three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm) differentiate and all major organ systems begin to form — the heart, brain, spinal cord, limbs, and facial features emerge. This is the period of greatest vulnerability to teratogens: major structural malformations are most likely to result from teratogen exposure during the embryonic stage. The fetal stage begins at the 9th week and continues until birth. During this stage, already-formed structures grow, mature, and become functional. Teratogens can still cause harm in the fetal period (particularly functional and behavioral deficits), but gross structural malformations are less likely than during embryonic development.",

      "question": "What is the difference between a teratogen and a mutagen?",
      "answer": "A teratogen is any environmental agent — drug, chemical, infectious organism, or physical factor — that disrupts normal prenatal development and produces structural or functional defects in the developing organism, without necessarily altering the genetic code. Examples include alcohol (fetal alcohol syndrome), thalidomide, rubella, and high-dose radiation. Teratogenic effects depend on timing, dose, and the genetic vulnerability of the embryo or fetus. A mutagen is an agent that permanently alters DNA structure or sequence, potentially producing heritable genetic mutations. Mutagens can act across the lifespan, not just prenatally. While all mutagens can theoretically cause teratogenic effects, not all teratogens are mutagens — many disrupt development through mechanisms other than DNA mutation (e.g., enzyme inhibition, cell death, disrupted cell signaling).",

      "answer": "Canalization refers to the degree to which a trait's developmental path is genetically buffered against environmental variation. Highly canalized traits (e.g., basic sensorimotor sequences, language acquisition milestones) follow a predictable developmental path and remain resilient to all but extreme environmental disruptions — many different environments produce the same outcome. Reaction range refers to the breadth of phenotypic outcomes that a given genotype can produce across the range of possible environments. A wide reaction range means the environment substantially shapes the expressed trait; a narrow reaction range means the trait remains similar across environments. Both concepts address gene-environment interaction, but canalization emphasizes resistance to developmental deviation, while reaction range emphasizes the breadth of possible phenotypic outcomes.",

      "question": "What is the difference between heritability and genetic determinism?",
      "answer": "Heritability is a statistical concept that estimates the proportion of variance in a trait within a specific population under specific environmental conditions that is attributable to genetic differences between individuals. A heritability of 0.70 for IQ means 70% of IQ score variability in that studied population can be attributed to genetic variation — not that 70% of any individual's IQ is genetically determined. Heritability estimates are population-specific, environment-specific, and change as environmental conditions change. Genetic determinism is the philosophical position that traits are fixed and inevitable based on one's genotype, regardless of environmental input. Behavioral genetics consistently refutes genetic determinism: even traits with high heritability show substantial environmental influence, and heritability evidence shows genes contribute probabilistically rather than deterministically.",
      "key_distinction": "Heritability = a population-level statistic estimating the genetic contribution to trait variance; Genetic determinism = the incorrect belief that genes rigidly fix individual outcomes.",

      "question": "What is the difference between a critical period and a sensitive period in development?",
      "answer": "A critical period is a fixed, time-limited window during which specific experiences are absolutely required for normal development. If the necessary input is absent during the critical period, normal development cannot occur and the resulting deficit is typically permanent and irreversible. The classic example is the visual system: covering one eye of a kitten during the first months of life causes permanent cortical reorganization and loss of normal binocular vision that cannot be restored later. A sensitive period is a more flexible optimal window during which experiences have their greatest formative influence, but development can still proceed — with considerably more effort — outside this window. Language acquisition has a sensitive period: individuals can learn language after childhood, but acquisition is slower and less complete. Sensitive periods are more common than true critical periods.",
      "key_distinction": "Critical period = absolute window (missed = permanent, irreversible deficit); Sensitive period = optimal window (missed = more difficulty, but development still possible).",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Both refer to time-limited periods of heightened developmental plasticity, and the terms are often used interchangeably in everyday language, obscuring the meaningful difference in reversibility.",

      "question": "What is the difference between Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome as examples of genomic imprinting?",
      "answer": "Both Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) involve deletion or inactivation of the same chromosomal region (15q11-q13), but the resulting syndrome depends entirely on which parent contributed the affected chromosome — a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. PWS results when the critical region on the paternally inherited chromosome 15 is deleted or inactivated (or when both chromosome 15s come from the mother — maternal uniparental disomy). It is characterized by hypotonia at birth, intellectual disability, insatiable appetite leading to obesity, short stature, and behavioral difficulties. AS results when the critical region on the maternally inherited chromosome 15 is deleted or inactivated (or paternal uniparental disomy). It is characterized by severe intellectual disability, absent or minimal speech, seizures, ataxic gait, and a characteristically happy, excitable affect with frequent laughing.",
      "key_distinction": "Same chromosome region (15q11-q13), different parent of origin: Prader-Willi = paternal deletion (hypotonia, hyperphagia, obesity); Angelman = maternal deletion (absent speech, seizures, happy affect).",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Both involve the same chromosomal locus and both present with intellectual disability; students who know one syndrome often cannot name the other or remember which parent's deletion causes which syndrome.",
