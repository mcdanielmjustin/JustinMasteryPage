      "explanation": "The original passage describes Kotter's eight-step model as a 'practical framework' for leading organizational change. The modified passage changed 'practical' to 'theoretical,' which mischaracterizes the nature of Kotter's contribution. Kotter's model is widely recognized for its practical, action-oriented approach to implementing change in organizations, building on Lewin's more foundational (and comparatively more theoretical) three-step model of unfreezing, changing, and refreezing."

While merit-based pay and incentive systems are related concepts, they are distinct: incentive systems broadly encompass various reward structures tied to performance output (consistent with Taylor's piece-rate pay approach), whereas merit-based pay specifically refers to salary increases based on performance evaluations—a more modern HR concept. The other options describe changes that were not actually made to the passage."

A Clinical Psychologist position requires a doctoral degree (Ph.D. or Psy.D.) in clinical psychology from an APA-accredited program, not a master's degree. State licensure as a psychologist universally requires doctoral-level training. This error was introduced by substituting 'Master's' for 'Doctoral' in the job specification excerpt."

      "explanation": "The error introduced was changing 'stable environments' to 'unstable environments' when describing where mechanistic structures work best. According to contingency theory (including the work of Lawrence and Lorsch, as well as Burns and Stalker), mechanistic structures—characterized by high formalization, centralization, and rigid hierarchies—are most effective in stable, predictable environments. Organic structures, which are flexible and decentralized, are better suited for uncertain, rapidly changing environments. The passage incorrectly reversed the environmental condition for mechanistic structures."

The modified passage incorrectly changed the outcome to 'changing their behavior on the job,' which is not the correct definition. The concept of perseverance in TWA is about how long someone tolerates a poor person-environment fit before actually quitting or departing from the position."

High group cohesiveness is characterized by a strong sense of group identity — not individual identity — along with a desire to maintain harmony.

      "correct_option_index": 2,
      "explanation": "The passage replaced 'groupthink' with 'group polarization.' While both are group decision-making phenomena, the original passage specifically highlights groupthink as the key group decision-making phenomenon tested on the EPPP. Groupthink, described by Irving Janis, refers to the tendency of highly cohesive groups to seek consensus at the expense of critical evaluation of alternatives. Group polarization, by contrast, refers to the tendency for group discussion to shift members' positions toward a more extreme version of their initial inclinations. The EPPP specifically emphasizes groupthink as the primary group decision-making phenomenon of concern."

The correct formulation is that organizational change transitions organizations 'from their current state to a desired future state,' not the other way around. The current state is the starting point, and the desired state is the goal. The other options describe plausible-sounding but incorrect alternatives: organizational development interventions is the correct term, resistance to change is correctly stated, and organizational culture is the appropriate term used in the original passage."

While interviews may be included as one component, the defining and distinguishing feature of assessment centers is the use of simulations, not interviews. Replacing 'simulations' with 'interviews' mischaracterizes the core methodology of assessment centers."

      "explanation": "While the passage explicitly lists 'motivation and readiness' as trainee characteristics affecting transfer, the established literature (e.g., Baldwin & Ford, 1988) identifies trainee characteristics as including cognitive ability, self-efficacy, and motivation. However, re-reading the passage, it actually does say 'motivation and readiness.' The error here is subtle: the passage itself uses 'readiness,' but in the broader training transfer literature, the classic trainee characteristics framework emphasizes self-efficacy rather than readiness as the paired factor with motivation. Actually, let me reconsider — the passage does list 'motivation and readiness,' so this is correctly reflecting the passage. The definition is correct relative to the passage content. The error needs to be something factually wrong."
