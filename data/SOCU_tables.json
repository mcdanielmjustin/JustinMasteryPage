This contrasts with ability, which is considered stable because it is perceived as relatively fixed over time. Effort is also unique among the four common attributions as the only one classified as controllable."

      "explanation": "The Dismissing-Avoidant style is characterized by a positive model of self but a negative model of others, leading to compulsive self-reliance and denial of attachment needs. This is easily confused with the Fearful-Avoidant style, which also involves avoidance of close relationships but stems from a negative model of both self and others (fear of being hurt), rather than viewing relationships as unimportant. Dismissing-Avoidant corresponds to avoidant infant attachment in Ainsworth's classification."
