This pattern reflects somatic complaints with denial of psychological distress and la belle indifference, and is the MMPI profile most associated with conversion disorder. This is easily confused with the 1-2/2-1 and 2-3/3-2 code types, which also involve somatic concerns but include prominent depression."

This is a commonly tested distinction on the EPPP because F and Fp are easily confused."
