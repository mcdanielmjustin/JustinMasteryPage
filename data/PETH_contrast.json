      "question": "What is the difference between the APA Ethics Code's General Principles and its Enforceable Standards?",
      "answer": "The General Principles (A–E: Beneficence & Nonmaleficence, Fidelity & Responsibility, Integrity, Justice, Respect for People's Rights and Dignity) are aspirational — they describe the ideal to which psychologists should strive. They are NOT enforceable and violations cannot be the sole basis for an ethics complaint. The Enforceable Standards (Standards 1–10) describe specific conduct that psychologists are obligated to follow. Violations of these standards CAN be the basis for ethics complaints, disciplinary action, and licensing board sanctions.",
      "key_distinction": "Principles = aspirational ideals (not enforceable); Standards = mandatory rules (enforceable).",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Both are in the APA Ethics Code document and students sometimes believe violating a principle is directly actionable.",

      "item_y": "Privilege",
      "question": "What is the difference between confidentiality and privilege?",
      "answer": "Confidentiality is an ethical (and legal) obligation that prohibits psychologists from disclosing client information without consent. It applies in all professional contexts — office, supervision, consultation, public settings. It is held and waived by the client. Privilege is a legal protection that specifically shields confidential communications from compelled disclosure in judicial and legal proceedings (court, depositions). It is also held by the client (not the therapist). When a client waives privilege, the therapist MUST testify. When subpoenaed without client authorization, the therapist should appear and assert privilege on the client's behalf.",

      "question": "What is the difference between the Tarasoff I and Tarasoff II rulings?",
      "answer": "Tarasoff I (1974): Established a 'duty to warn' the identifiable potential victim of a credible, serious threat made by a client. The therapist is obligated to notify the threatened person. Tarasoff II (1976): Expanded the obligation to a broader 'duty to protect' — requiring the therapist to take reasonable steps to protect the potential victim, which may include warning the victim, notifying police, hospitalizing the client, or a combination. Tarasoff II is stricter. Most states now follow a 'duty to protect' standard. The duty applies only when the threat is serious, credible, imminent, and directed at an identifiable victim.",
      "key_distinction": "Tarasoff I = warn the victim; Tarasoff II = protect the potential victim (broader steps required).",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Both involve the same case and both mandate some action; the distinction is whether warning alone is sufficient (I) or broader protective action is required (II).",

      "question": "What is the difference between mandatory and permissive reporting obligations for psychologists?",
      "answer": "Mandatory reporting requires the psychologist to report to authorities regardless of client consent or wishes — and failure to report is itself a legal violation. Child abuse, elder abuse, and dependent adult abuse are mandatory reports in all U.S. states. Permissive (discretionary) reporting allows the psychologist to breach confidentiality when they judge it appropriate, but does not require it. Imminent danger to self in some jurisdictions, or some other situations, may be permissive rather than mandatory. The Tarasoff duty to protect is often treated as mandatory in practice, though implementation varies by state.",
      "key_distinction": "Mandatory = must report regardless of client wishes (failure is a violation); Permissive = may report at professional judgment.",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Students may believe all confidentiality exceptions are equally mandatory; child abuse reporting is mandatory but some situations only permit (not require) disclosure.",

      "question": "What is the difference between clinical supervision and consultation?",
      "answer": "In clinical supervision, the supervisor assumes legal and ethical responsibility for the supervisee's cases and clinical work. The supervisor has evaluative authority and can direct the supervisee's actions. This is a formal hierarchical relationship. Clients must be informed when they are seen by a supervised trainee. In consultation, the consultant provides expert advice to a colleague (consultee) on a case, but the consultee retains full legal and ethical responsibility for their own decisions and treatment. The consultation relationship is collegial, not hierarchical, and the consultee is free to accept or reject the consultant's advice.",
      "key_distinction": "Supervision = supervisor holds legal responsibility for supervisee's work; Consultation = consultant advises, consultee retains full responsibility.",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Both involve an experienced clinician providing guidance on cases; the question of who bears legal responsibility is the critical distinction.",

      "item_y": "Abandonment",
      "question": "What is the difference between ethical termination and abandonment in therapy?",
      "answer": "Ethical termination occurs when therapy ends with adequate notice, appropriate transition planning, referrals if needed, and in a way that serves the client's interests. It may be initiated by either party. Abandonment (unethical) occurs when the therapist abruptly discontinues services without notice, without ensuring continuity of care, or without referral — particularly when the client is still in need. It is an ethics violation. Ethically, when a client is no longer benefiting and progress goals cannot be agreed upon, the therapist should refer to another provider rather than simply stopping without planning.",
      "key_distinction": "Ethical termination = planned, with notice, referrals, and transition; Abandonment = abrupt discontinuation without planning when client is still in need.",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Both involve ending therapy; the presence or absence of planning, notice, and continuity of care determines the ethical distinction.",

      "item_y": "Ethics code violation",
      "question": "What is the difference between a malpractice claim and an ethics code violation?",
      "answer": "A malpractice claim is a civil legal action alleging professional negligence. It requires proof of four elements (the 4 D's): (1) Duty of care existed; (2) Dereliction of duty (breach of standard of care); (3) Direct causation — the breach caused; (4) Damages to the client. The standard is compared to what a reasonably competent psychologist would do. An ethics code violation is a professional/disciplinary matter handled by the APA Ethics Committee or state licensing board. It does not require proof of damages — violating an enforceable standard is sufficient grounds. A single incident may lead to both a malpractice suit and an ethics complaint, or just one.",
      "key_distinction": "Malpractice = civil legal claim requiring proof of harm and causation; Ethics violation = professional/disciplinary action based on deviation from code.",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Students may not know the 4 D's required for malpractice or that ethics violations do not require proof of damages.",

      "question": "What is the difference between informed consent and assent in research and treatment contexts?",
      "answer": "Informed consent is obtained from adults with legal decision-making capacity, who voluntarily agree to treatment or research participation after being informed of procedures, risks, benefits, alternatives, and the right to withdraw. Adults have both the legal authority and (presumed) cognitive capacity to consent. Assent is sought from minors or individuals without legal capacity. Because minors cannot legally consent, a parent or guardian provides legally valid permission (consent). The minor's assent — their affirmative agreement to participate given their developmental level — is also sought. Assent does not override the guardian's consent but adds the child's voice and ethical weight.",
      "key_distinction": "Informed consent = adult's legally valid agreement; Assent = minor's developmentally appropriate agreement (parent provides formal consent).",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Students use 'consent' for all populations; the legal permission vs. developmental agreement distinction is often missed.",

      "item_y": "Accepting gifts from clients",
      "question": "What is the difference between bartering with clients and accepting gifts from clients in a therapeutic relationship?",
      "answer": "Under APA Standard 6.05, bartering—accepting goods, services, or other nonmonetary remuneration from clients in lieu of payment—is permissible only if: (1) it is not clinically contraindicated, and (2) it does not create an exploitative or unfair arrangement. Because psychotherapy can inflate the perceived value of client-provided services and complicate the therapeutic relationship, bartering is discouraged but explicitly conditionally allowed. Accepting gifts from clients is not directly addressed by a single APA standard but implicates multiple relationship concerns (Standard 3.05) and professional boundary considerations. Small, culturally normative gifts may be clinically appropriate; larger gifts or patterns of gift-giving can blur professional boundaries, create obligation, or reflect therapeutic material that warrants clinical attention. The critical difference is that bartering involves a formal alternative-fee arrangement (an agreed exchange), whereas gifts are gratuitous, one-way transfers with no expectation of services in return.",
      "key_distinction": "Bartering = formal alternative-fee exchange, conditionally permitted under Standard 6.05 if not clinically contraindicated or exploitative; Gift acceptance = one-way gratuitous transfer, no explicit APA standard, governed by multiple-relationship and clinical-judgment principles.",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Both involve receiving something of value from a client that is not cash, and both can blur professional boundaries; students often do not know that bartering is explicitly addressed under Standard 6.05 while gift acceptance is not covered by a single dedicated standard.",

      "item_y": "Client abandonment (Standards 3.12 / 10.10)",
      "question": "What is the difference between withholding records for nonpayment and client abandonment?",
      "answer": "APA Standard 6.03 states that psychologists may not withhold records needed for a client's immediate care solely because the client has not paid for prior services. When a client's ongoing care depends on access to records, fee disputes cannot block that access. However, if the records are not urgently needed for care, withholding them pending payment may be permissible under state law, though it remains ethically discouraged. Client abandonment (addressed in Standards 3.12 and 10.10) occurs when a therapist abruptly terminates services without adequate notice, referrals, or transition planning while the client still requires care. Abandonment is always an ethics violation. The distinction is about what is being withheld (records vs. services) and the conditions under which withholding is ever permissible.",
      "key_distinction": "Withholding records for nonpayment = never permissible when records are needed for immediate care (Standard 6.03); Abandonment = always unethical termination of services without care continuity (Standard 10.10).",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Both involve withholding something from a client in a fee dispute, and both can jeopardize client welfare; students may not know that Standard 6.03 specifically protects access to records when immediate care is at stake, or may conflate record withholding with service termination.",

      "question": "What is the difference between informal resolution and formal reporting of APA ethics code violations?",
      "answer": "Standard 1.04 (Informal Resolution): When a psychologist believes a colleague has violated the APA Ethics Code, and if doing so would not compromise confidentiality and the violation seems amenable to informal resolution, the psychologist should first attempt to resolve it by bringing it to the individual's attention. This is the appropriate first-line response for apparent or minor violations. Standard 1.05 (Reporting Ethics Violations): When informal resolution is not appropriate, not successful, or the violation is substantial, the psychologist should take further action—referring the matter to a state or national ethics committee, licensing board, or other relevant authority. Informal resolution is NOT required when: the violation is serious, imminent harm exists, or attempting informal resolution would compromise confidentiality.",
      "key_distinction": "Informal resolution (1.04) = attempt to address the violation directly with the colleague first; Formal reporting (1.05) = escalate to an ethics committee or licensing board when informal resolution is inappropriate, fails, or the violation is serious.",

      "question": "What is the difference between the competence requirement under Standard 2.01 and the emergency exception under Standard 2.02?",
      "answer": "Standard 2.01 (Boundaries of Competence) requires psychologists to provide services, teach, and conduct research only within the boundaries of their competence, based on education, training, supervised experience, consultation, study, or professional experience. Practicing outside established competence areas is an ethics violation. Standard 2.02 (Providing Services in Emergencies) creates an explicit, narrow exception: when psychological services are urgently needed and no other competent professional is reasonably available, a psychologist may provide services outside their normal competence boundaries in order to ensure the individual's wellbeing. However, Standard 2.02 requires that the out-of-competence services cease as soon as the emergency ends or a qualified professional becomes available. The emergency exception is temporary, not a license to expand scope of practice.",

      "question": "What is the difference between licensure and professional certification for psychologists?",
      "answer": "Licensure is a legal credential issued by a state government that is required by law to practice psychology in that state. It is a regulatory mechanism that restricts both the title 'psychologist' and the practice of psychology to those who meet state-defined requirements (doctoral degree, supervised experience hours, EPPP passage, and any state-specific exam). Practicing psychology without a license is a legal violation. Professional certification (e.g., ABPP—American Board of Professional Psychology) is a voluntary credential issued by a professional organization that recognizes specialty competence beyond minimum licensure requirements. Certification is not legally required to practice; it signals advanced expertise in a specialty area (e.g., clinical neuropsychology, forensic psychology) and is sought voluntarily.",

      "answer": "A subpoena is a legal document issued by an attorney (not a judge) requiring a psychologist to appear at a proceeding (deposition, hearing) or to produce records. Receiving a subpoena does NOT automatically require the psychologist to disclose confidential client information—it triggers an obligation to respond, not an obligation to release records. The appropriate response is to: (1) notify the client, (2) seek client authorization for release if appropriate, or (3) assert privilege on the client's behalf if the client objects. A court order is issued by a judge and carries greater legal authority. When a court has considered a privilege claim and nevertheless orders disclosure, the psychologist is legally compelled to comply. Refusing to comply with a valid court order can result in contempt of court.",
      "key_distinction": "Subpoena = issued by an attorney, does NOT automatically override therapist-client privilege; Court order = issued by a judge, legally compels disclosure even over a privilege objection.",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Both are legal documents that require a response, and students often believe receiving a subpoena means records must be immediately produced; the critical distinction is that only a judge's court order overrides privilege.",

Standard 8.05 permits dispensing with informed consent only when: (1) the research would not reasonably cause distress or harm and involves only anonymous questionnaires, naturalistic observations, or archival data; (2) the research examines normal educational practices or program effectiveness in authorized educational settings; or (3) an IRB or ethics board has determined that informed consent is not required under applicable guidelines.

Deception is permissible only if: (1) the research has significant scientific, educational, or applied value; (2) non-deceptive alternative procedures are not feasible; and (3) participants are not deceived about aspects that would cause significant pain or severe emotional distress. Psychologists must NOT deceive participants about aspects that would cause them to refuse participation if they knew. Standard 8.08 (Debriefing) governs the post-study obligation: psychologists must provide a prompt debriefing explaining the true purpose and nature of the study, including disclosing and correcting any deception used. If scientific value requires delaying the debriefing, the delay must be justified and debriefing must still ultimately occur. Deception (8.07) is a conditional permission during the study; debriefing (8.08) is the mandatory corrective obligation after the study.",
