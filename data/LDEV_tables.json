This is commonly tested because it persists significantly longer than other reflexes such as Moro (5–6 months) or palmar grasp (3–4 months), and its persistence beyond 12 months can indicate neurological abnormality."

This distinguishes Type A from Type C (ambivalent), where distress is overtly and intensely expressed."
