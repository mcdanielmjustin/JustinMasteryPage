      "question": "What is the difference between microassault and microinvalidation (Sue et al.)?",
      "answer": "A microassault is the most conscious and deliberate form of microaggression — similar to old-fashioned discrimination. It intentionally communicates prejudice or demeans a person based on their identity (e.g., using racial slurs, deliberately serving a person of color last). It is an explicit act. A microinvalidation communicates that the experiences, feelings, or existential reality of people from marginalized groups are invalid, unimportant, or nonexistent. Examples include 'Where are you really from?' (denying someone's American identity) or telling a person of color that you 'don't see color.' Microinsults are rude, insensitive communications that demean someone's racial or group identity (between the two extremes).",

      "question": "What is the difference between the Conformity and Integrative Awareness stages in the racial/cultural identity development model?",
      "answer": "In the Conformity stage, an individual from a minority group has internalized the dominant culture's values and preferences, often preferring the dominant culture over their own. They may deprecate their own group and idealize the majority culture. They may prefer a therapist from the dominant culture. In the Integrative Awareness stage (the most mature), the individual has moved through conflict and resistance to develop a secure, multicultural perspective — able to appreciate cultural differences, critically evaluate all cultures, and integrate a positive sense of their own identity without rejecting others. They prefer a therapist who is culturally sensitive, regardless of background.",

      "question": "What is the difference between acculturation and assimilation?",
      "answer": "Acculturation refers to the broad process of cultural and psychological change that occurs when individuals from different cultural backgrounds come into sustained contact. Berry's model identifies four acculturation strategies as possible outcomes: integration (biculturalism), assimilation, separation, and marginalization. Acculturation itself does not imply any particular outcome — the individual may retain, abandon, or blend aspects of both cultures. Assimilation is one specific acculturation strategy in which an individual adopts the culture of the dominant or host group and abandons or minimizes their culture of origin. It is just one of the four possible outcomes within Berry's acculturation framework.",

      "answer": "Cultural competence is a framework that treats cross-cultural knowledge and skill as an achievable endpoint — a state that can be reached through training and education. It emphasizes acquiring knowledge about specific cultural groups and developing skills for effective cross-cultural work. Cultural humility (Tervalon & Murray-Garcia, 1998) treats multicultural learning as a lifelong process of critical self-reflection rather than a destination. It emphasizes acknowledging one's own cultural biases and limitations, engaging in ongoing self-critique, entering a power-sharing relationship with clients, and remaining open to learning from clients about their experiences. Cultural humility explicitly addresses institutional power imbalances and the therapist's own social position.",
      "key_distinction": "Cultural competence = achievable knowledge/skill endpoint; Cultural humility = ongoing self-reflection, power-sharing, and openness — a process, not a destination.",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Both relate to effective multicultural practice; cultural humility is a newer concept that critiques the static 'mastery' implied by the term 'competence.'",

      "answer": "The Minority Identity Development (MID) model (Atkinson, Morten & Sue) describes five stages through which individuals from minority racial/ethnic groups develop their cultural identity: Conformity, Dissonance, Resistance & Immersion, Introspection, and Integrative Awareness. It focuses on how a minority individual moves from internalized racism toward a secure, multicultural identity. Helms's White Racial Identity Development model describes a parallel process for White individuals, who must abandon a racist identity and develop a positive, nonracist White identity. Helms's model has two phases: abandoning racism (Contact, Disintegration, Reintegration) and developing a nonracist identity (Pseudo-Independence, Immersion/Emersion, Autonomy). Both models are stage-based but address fundamentally different populations and psychological challenges.",

      "answer": "In the Immersion-Emersion stage, an individual fully immerses themselves in Black culture and ideology, often idealizing everything Black and denigrating the dominant White culture. This stage is characterized by intense anger, strong racial pride, and a reactive, oppositional stance — the identity is largely defined in contrast to whiteness. In the Internalization stage, the individual's Black identity becomes secure, stable, and internally defined — no longer dependent on rejection of whiteness. The defensive anger softens, and the individual develops the psychological security to engage constructively with members of other racial groups, form cross-racial alliances, and maintain a strong Black identity without reactivity.",

      "answer": "The fundamental attribution error is the tendency to overestimate dispositional (personality) factors and underestimate situational factors when explaining OTHER PEOPLE'S behavior. We blame the person's character without sufficiently considering the context they are in. Self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute our own SUCCESSES to internal, dispositional factors (ability, effort) and our own FAILURES to external, situational factors (bad luck, unfair circumstances). FAE applies to how we judge others; self-serving bias applies to how we explain our own outcomes.",

The actor-observer effect describes an asymmetry: as ACTORS explaining our own behavior, we tend to attribute it to the SITUATION; as OBSERVERS explaining others' behavior, we tend to attribute it to THEIR DISPOSITIONS. The FAE is the observer side of the actor-observer effect, but the actor-observer effect also captures the complementary tendency to explain our own behavior situationally.",

      "answer": "Central route processing occurs when a person has both the motivation and the ability to carefully think about and evaluate the content of a persuasive message. Strong, logical arguments produce durable attitude change that predicts future behavior. Peripheral route processing occurs when the person lacks motivation or ability to process the message thoughtfully and instead relies on superficial cues: source attractiveness, expertise, credibility, endorsements, or emotional appeals. Attitude change from peripheral processing is temporary and weakly predictive of behavior. Attitude change from the central route is stronger and more resistant to counter-persuasion.",

      "answer": "The foot-in-the-door technique begins with a SMALL request, to which the person usually agrees. Later, a LARGER request is made. Compliance with the larger request increases because of commitment and consistency — people want to behave consistently with their earlier agreement. The door-in-the-face technique begins with a LARGE, unreasonable request that is expected to be refused. After refusal, a SMALLER (actual) request is made. Compliance increases because of reciprocal concession — the requester appears to have made a concession, so the target feels obligated to reciprocate with compliance.",

      "answer": "Normative social influence occurs when people conform to gain approval, avoid rejection, or fit in — even when they privately disagree. The person complies publicly but does not change their private belief. This was demonstrated in Asch's line-length conformity studies: subjects went along with the clearly wrong group answer to avoid looking deviant. Informational social influence occurs when people conform because they are genuinely uncertain about the correct response and look to others as sources of information. This produces both public compliance and private acceptance. Sherif's autokinetic phenomenon studies demonstrated informational influence.",

      "answer": "Social facilitation (Zajonc) refers to the improvement in performance on EASY or well-learned tasks when an audience is present. The audience increases arousal, which strengthens the dominant response — on easy tasks, this improves performance. On difficult/novel tasks, increased arousal impairs performance (social inhibition). Social loafing (Latané) refers to the reduction in individual effort and performance when working AS PART OF A GROUP on a collective task, compared to working individually. It occurs because individual contributions are less identifiable, reducing personal accountability.",

      "answer": "Prejudice is an attitude — a preconceived, typically negative evaluation of a person or group based on their membership in a social category. It exists internally and may not be expressed behaviorally. Discrimination is behavior — differential treatment of individuals based on their group membership. It is the behavioral expression of prejudice. While prejudice often leads to discrimination, they are dissociable: a person can hold prejudiced attitudes and not discriminate (fear of legal consequences), or can discriminate without personal prejudice (following a discriminatory institutional policy).",

      "answer": "The availability heuristic involves estimating the frequency or probability of an event based on how easily examples come to mind (how available they are in memory). Events that are vivid, recent, or emotionally salient are judged as more frequent (e.g., overestimating the probability of plane crashes because they receive dramatic media coverage). The representativeness heuristic involves judging the probability that something belongs to a category based on how closely it resembles the prototype of that category, ignoring base rates. For example, assuming someone who likes poetry and is quiet must be a librarian (ignoring that there are far more salespeople).",

      "answer": "Realistic conflict theory (Sherif) holds that intergroup hostility, discrimination, and prejudice arise from actual competition over limited, desired resources (jobs, territory, power). When groups compete for scarce resources, negative attitudes and conflict emerge. Reducing conflict requires superordinate goals requiring cooperation. Social identity theory (Tajfel & Turner) proposes that prejudice arises from the mere categorization of people into in-groups and out-groups, even without resource competition. People favor their in-group to enhance self-esteem. Minimal group paradigm studies showed that arbitrary group assignments alone produce in-group favoritism.",

It is associated with high physiological arousal and tends to be most intense in new relationships. In Sternberg's triangular theory, passionate love corresponds primarily to the Passion component. Companionate love involves deep affection, trust, mutual caring, and commitment without the intense arousal of passionate love. It corresponds to Intimacy + Commitment in Sternberg's model and tends to characterize long-term, stable relationships.

      "answer": "A fear appeal is a persuasive message designed to arouse fear by highlighting the negative consequences of not complying with the recommended action (e.g., anti-smoking campaigns showing diseased lungs). According to protection motivation theory, fear appeals are most effective when the perceived threat is high AND the recommended action is seen as effective and feasible. A rational appeal persuades through logical arguments, facts, statistics, and evidence, relying on the audience's capacity for systematic evaluation. Rational appeals engage central route processing (ELM) and tend to produce stronger, more durable attitude change. Fear appeals primarily engage emotional processing; very high fear can produce defensive avoidance rather than attitude change, creating an inverted-U relationship between fear intensity and persuasive impact.",

      "answer": "In persuasion, the primacy effect occurs when information presented FIRST has greater influence on final attitudes than later information — early information creates a cognitive framework that colors interpretation of subsequent content. The recency effect occurs when information presented LAST has the greatest persuasive influence. Miller and Campbell (1959) identified the conditions favoring each: the primacy effect is most likely when the two sides of an argument are presented back-to-back (no delay between them) but attitudes are assessed after a significant delay. The recency effect is most likely when there is a delay between the two sides but attitudes are assessed immediately after the second side. In neutral conditions, primacy tends to predominate.",

      "answer": "Cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957) proposes that when a person holds two psychologically inconsistent cognitions — or behaves in ways inconsistent with an attitude — an aversive arousal state (dissonance) is produced. To reduce this unpleasant tension, the person changes an attitude, adds a new cognition, or trivializes the inconsistency. Attitude change is driven by the need to eliminate internal discomfort. Self-perception theory (Bem, 1972) proposes that people come to know their own attitudes by observing their own behavior, much as they would infer a stranger's attitude. No aversive arousal is required — people simply infer 'I must believe X since I acted as if X were true.' Both theories predict attitude change following counter-attitudinal behavior with insufficient justification, but dissonance requires prior inconsistency and felt arousal, while self-perception requires only ambiguity about one's prior attitude.",

      "answer": "Groupthink (Janis, 1972) is a mode of faulty group decision-making occurring in highly cohesive groups under pressure, characterized by an illusion of invulnerability, collective rationalization, self-censorship, pressure on dissenters, and the illusion of unanimity. The result is premature consensus and critically unevaluated decisions (e.g., Bay of Pigs invasion, Challenger disaster). The key dynamic is suppression of dissent to preserve group cohesion. Group polarization is the finding that group discussion shifts members' attitudes toward a more extreme version of their initial pre-discussion position — if members lean toward risk, they become riskier; if cautious, more cautious. Group polarization involves open discussion that amplifies the dominant position rather than silencing alternatives.",

      "commonly_confused_because": "Both are group phenomena that can lead to poor outcomes, but groupthink involves silencing alternatives to maintain false unanimity while group polarization involves genuine discussion that amplifies the majority tendency.",

      "question": "What is the difference between confirmation bias and hindsight bias?",
      "answer": "Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, notice, interpret, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or expectations, while ignoring or underweighting disconfirming evidence. It operates prospectively as a person gathers and processes new information going forward. Hindsight bias (the 'I-knew-it-all-along' phenomenon) is the tendency, after learning the outcome of an event, to overestimate how predictable that outcome was before it occurred. It operates retrospectively — once the answer is known, memory for prior uncertainty is distorted toward the actual outcome. Confirmation bias involves selective attention going forward; hindsight bias involves distorted reconstruction of past knowledge states. Both can inflate overconfidence, but through distinct temporal mechanisms.",
      "key_distinction": "Confirmation bias = prospective selective attention toward belief-confirming evidence; Hindsight bias = retrospective exaggeration of prior predictability after outcome is known.",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Both involve cognitive distortions relative to what one 'already believed' and both inflate overconfidence; students conflate the prospective (seeking confirmation) versus retrospective (recalling prior knowledge) nature of each bias.",

      "question": "What is the difference between the mere exposure effect and the similarity-attraction effect in interpersonal attraction?",
      "answer": "The mere exposure effect (Zajonc, 1968) is the finding that repeated exposure to a stimulus — including a person — increases liking for it, even in the absence of any interaction, shared characteristics, or reward. Familiarity alone is sufficient to generate positive affect. The similarity-attraction effect is the finding that people are more attracted to others who share similar attitudes, values, personality traits, and interests. Theoretical explanations include cognitive balance (similar others create balanced relational triads) and social validation (similar others confirm one's worldview and reinforce self-esteem). Mere exposure explains attraction based on proximity and frequency of contact; similarity-attraction explains deeper bonding through attitudinal matching. The two can act in concert — proximity increases exposure AND creates opportunities to discover similarity — but the mechanisms are distinct.",

      "commonly_confused_because": "Both explain why we like certain people and can operate simultaneously with the same target person; the mechanism (passive familiarity vs. active attitudinal matching) distinguishes them.",

      "answer": "Explicit attitudes are consciously held, deliberately expressed evaluations that a person is aware of and can report directly via self-report measures (e.g., surveys, Likert scales). They are subject to deliberate control and can be influenced by social desirability — people may adjust their reports to appear consistent with prevailing norms. Implicit attitudes are automatically activated evaluations that operate below conscious awareness and are not accessible to direct self-report. They are measured indirectly using response latency paradigms such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Explicit and implicit attitudes toward the same object can diverge substantially: a person may explicitly report egalitarian attitudes while the IAT reveals automatic in-group preference. Implicit attitudes tend to better predict spontaneous, uncontrolled behaviors; explicit attitudes better predict deliberate, planned behaviors.",
      "key_distinction": "Explicit attitudes = consciously reported evaluations via direct self-report; Implicit attitudes = automatically activated evaluations outside awareness, measured indirectly (e.g., IAT).",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Students assume attitude measurement always captures what people 'really believe'; the dissociation between conscious self-report and automatically activated evaluations — and their differential prediction of behavior — is frequently overlooked.",

      "question": "What is the difference between diffusion of responsibility and pluralistic ignorance as explanations for bystander apathy?",
      "answer": "Diffusion of responsibility (Darley & Latané, 1968) is the tendency for individuals to feel less personally obligated to intervene in an emergency when other people are present, because moral responsibility is perceived as shared across all bystanders — each assumes someone else will act. It operates AFTER the situation has been recognized as an emergency: the problem is reduced felt obligation, not misreading the event. Pluralistic ignorance is the tendency to privately hold a belief or feeling while incorrectly assuming that others hold a different view. In a bystander context, an ambiguous emergency may not look like one because each bystander looks to the others, sees them remaining calm and inactive, and concludes the situation is not an emergency — even though every bystander privately feels uncertain. Pluralistic ignorance operates BEFORE emergency recognition: it prevents the situation from being defined as one requiring help in the first place.",
      "key_distinction": "Diffusion of responsibility = recognized emergency but reduced personal obligation due to shared group responsibility; Pluralistic ignorance = failure to recognize the situation as an emergency because others appear calm.",
      "commonly_confused_because": "Both are mechanisms of bystander apathy and both involve others' presence; the stage at which each operates differs — pluralistic ignorance affects situation interpretation, diffusion of responsibility affects action despite correct interpretation.",
