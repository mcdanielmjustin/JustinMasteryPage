Key elements vary by state but typically include: (1) serious threat (not vague or hypothetical); (2) credibility based on clinical assessment (means, intent, plan, history); (3) identifiable victim. In this case, the patient names Jake, expresses explicit violent imagery, and has conditional threat language ('if he writes me up again'), but explicitly denies intent, demonstrates strong protective factors, and reports treatment progress. A thorough risk assessment — not an automatic warning — is the appropriate next step.",

Immediate warning or hospitalization is not clinically indicated when risk is assessed as manageable with outpatient interventions and the patient explicitly denies intent and identifies strong deterrents.",

            "A": "Warning Jake is a Tarasoff duty-to-protect option, but it is not automatically triggered by any violent ideation toward a named person. The clinical assessment determines the proportionality of response. Warning is one option — usually alongside other interventions — when risk is determined to be serious and credible.",
