      "explanation": "The passage incorrectly describes peak experiences as 'enduring but transformative.' According to Maslow's concept, peak experiences are 'transient but transformative' — they are brief, momentary episodes of profound joy and transcendence, not lasting states. Their defining characteristic is that despite being temporary in duration, they can have a lasting transformative impact on the individual."

      "explanation": "In the Assessment phase of EMDR, the clinician identifies the target memory, the negative cognition associated with it, the desired positive cognition, and establishes a baseline SUDs (Subjective Units of Disturbance Scale) rating. The passage incorrectly substituted 'VOC' (Validity of Cognition), which is a different measure used in EMDR but is not what is established as a baseline in the Assessment phase description. SUDs measures the level of disturbance, while VOC measures how true the positive cognition feels to the client."

      "correct_option_index": 1,
      "explanation": "The passage incorrectly describes activity scheduling as producing 'negative reinforcement' when it should say 'positive reinforcement.' Activity scheduling is a behavioral technique in which clients systematically plan and engage in activities that are likely to produce positive reinforcement (e.g., pleasure, mastery, social connection), even during periods of low motivation. Negative reinforcement involves the removal of an aversive stimulus to strengthen behavior, which is a different concept and not the primary mechanism targeted by activity scheduling."

      "correct_option_index": 1,
      "explanation": "The passage substituted 'punishment' for 'reinforcement.' Contingency management (CM) is defined by the systematic application of reinforcement contingencies — not punishment contingencies — to shape behavior. CM techniques such as voucher-based reinforcement and prize incentives rely on positive reinforcement principles to increase desired behaviors (e.g., abstinence from substances) and decrease undesired behaviors. While punishment can be part of broader behavioral interventions, CM is specifically characterized by its use of reinforcement."

This is a key concept reversal — substituting 'specific factors' for 'common factors' contradicts the central finding of Wampold's work, which supports the common factors model of psychotherapy."

      "modified_passage": "Prevention research has increasingly focused on identifying protective factors that buffer individuals against developing psychological disorders, even in the presence of significant risk factors. Key protective factors include strong social support networks, effective coping skills, and high self-efficacy. Research by Emmy Werner's landmark longitudinal study of children on the island of Kauai demonstrated that approximately one-half of children who grew up in high-risk environments (poverty, parental psychopathology, perinatal stress) developed into competent, confident, and caring adults by age 30. Werner identified several protective factors, including having at least one stable, supportive caregiver, an easy temperament, and an external locus of control. These findings have been foundational for the resilience framework and for designing prevention programs that aim to strengthen protective factors rather than solely targeting risk reduction.",

Approximately one-third of the high-risk children in Werner's study developed into well-adjusted adults, and the study did follow participants to ages beyond 30 (including age 32 and age 40), but the error introduced was specifically the reversal of internal to external locus of control."

Albert Ellis, who developed Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), referred to irrational beliefs such as demandingness, awfulizing, and low frustration tolerance. A key distinction is that Beck's approach uses collaborative empiricism to help clients test their automatic thoughts, while Ellis's approach is more confrontational and uses logical disputation.

Global rating, as an irrational belief identified in Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), refers to condemning the total self, others, or life based on single instances — meaning one draws sweeping conclusions from just one event or characteristic. Changing 'single' to 'repeated' fundamentally alters the concept, since the irrationality of global rating lies precisely in the overgeneralization from a single instance to the whole."

      "explanation": "Circular causality is contrasted with linear causality in systems theory. The original passage states that behavior is mutually influenced 'rather than in a linear cause-effect chain.' The term 'recursive' was incorrectly substituted for 'linear.' Linear causality assumes a one-directional cause-and-effect relationship (A causes B), whereas circular causality recognizes mutual, bidirectional influence. 'Recursive' is actually more closely associated with circular/systemic thinking, making it an incorrect contrast term here."

However, the passage mixes terminology from the traditional three-tier model (primary, secondary, tertiary), where screening and early identification of at-risk individuals is correctly classified as secondary prevention. The error here is subtle: within the IOM framework specifically, this activity would more precisely be classified as 'indicated prevention' (for those already showing early signs). But since the passage uses the traditional model's terminology consistently, the sentence is actually correct under that model. Re-evaluating: The passage is correct as stated under the traditional model. Let me introduce a different error."

Continuous reinforcement would actually make behavior easier to extinguish. The error substitutes 'continuous' for 'intermittent,' which requires specific knowledge of reinforcement schedules and their relationship to resistance to extinction."

(1986) found that approximately 50% of patients improved by session 8, but 75% of patients showed improvement by approximately session 26 is actually a commonly cited figure. However, the original landmark study reported that about 75% of patients were measurably improved by session 52 (one year of weekly therapy), not session 26. The error subtly changes the number of sessions needed for the 75% improvement benchmark."
