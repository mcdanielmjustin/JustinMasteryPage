Binge Eating Disorder (BED) is distinguished from Bulimia Nervosa specifically by the absence of compensatory behaviors (such as purging, excessive exercise, or fasting). 'Restrictive behaviors' is a plausible-sounding but incorrect substitution — restrictive behaviors are more associated with Anorexia Nervosa. BED was indeed elevated to a full diagnosis in DSM-5 after being listed as a condition for further study in DSM-IV's appendix."

      "explanation": "The passage was modified to say 'diagnostic criterion' instead of the correct term 'etiological criterion.' The distinction is important: the DSM-5 Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders chapter is unified by the requirement that an identifiable stressor serves as an etiological (causal) criterion — meaning the stressor is understood as a cause of the disorder, not merely a descriptive diagnostic feature. 'Etiological' refers to causation, which is a unique feature of this diagnostic chapter, as most other DSM-5 chapters are descriptive and atheoretical regarding etiology. PTSD was indeed previously classified as an anxiety disorder in DSM-IV, and disinhibited social engagement disorder is correctly listed as part of this chapter."

While many individuals with Bipolar I do experience major depressive episodes, they are not a diagnostic requirement.

Generalized would mean the dysfunction occurs across all situations, partners, and types of stimulation.

      "explanation": "The passage introduces an error by replacing 'bradycardia' (abnormally slow heart rate) with 'tachycardia' (abnormally fast heart rate). In BII (Blood-Injection-Injury) phobia, the characteristic vasovagal response involves an initial sympathetic spike followed by a parasympathetic rebound that produces bradycardia (slowed heart rate) and hypotension (lowered blood pressure), which leads to fainting. Tachycardia is the opposite — an increased heart rate — and is not part of the vasovagal response seen in BII phobia. This distinction is clinically important because it explains why applied tension (which raises blood pressure) is used instead of relaxation techniques (which would worsen the hypotension and bradycardia)."

      "explanation": "Blood-injection-injury (BII) type specific phobia is uniquely associated with a vasovagal response, not a sympathetic nervous system response. The vasovagal response involves an initial brief sympathetic activation followed by a parasympathetic (vagal) rebound that causes a drop in heart rate and blood pressure, leading to fainting. This diphasic vasovagal pattern distinguishes BII phobia from all other specific phobias, which are characterized by sustained sympathetic arousal."

However, the real error here is that the passage states '6 months in adults and 4 weeks in children' when the DSM-5 actually specifies '4 weeks in children and adolescents.' More critically, the target definition's stated durations are actually correct but incomplete — the key factual error intended is reversing the adult criterion: DSM-5 does not require 6 months for adults specifically in separation anxiety disorder; it requires at least 6 months in adults and at least 4 weeks in children and adolescents, which is correctly stated. Let me correct this: the error is that the definition says '6 months in adults and 4 weeks in children' but the DSM-5 actually requires at least 4 weeks in children/adolescents and at least 6 months in adults — these are correct. The actual planted error should be revised."
